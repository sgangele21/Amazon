+1	Definately worth buying. Fits the BJorn perfectly. Saves you from needing to wash the entire thing and keeps your baby from resting against the soaked fabric of the BJorn. You get 2 for the price, so it's worth it.
+1	Awesome smock.  Great for mealtimes and craft/art time.  Durable and easy to clean.  Fabric is comfortable (not too plasticy feeling) to the touch.
-1	But my seven month old daughter HATES it. She gets so overheated, and it's only November. I cannot imagine using this in hot weather. I finally just found a 100 percent cotton long sleeve bib from Etsy. This won't be used. What a waste of $30 dollars.
+1	We were looking for something that keeps our 10 month old twins clothes clean during solid feeds. We tried every bib out there, but finally found this. This product is great because it keeps their sleeves clean, as well as the rest of the clothes. It's definitely more expensive than bibs, but you get your money back by not needing to use stain remover!
+1	love it since 3yrs ago I bought one for my older son. now I am purchasing it again it already says how much I love this product! great for not just eating messy food but also for painting and other activities. easy to clean
+1	I was so like the overalls. It helped me a favor. Easy to clean, easy to dry. Color is also very nice. I love it.
+1	I waited a really long time to buy this because it felt like a lot of money to pay for a smock. I regret waiting at all. It makes feeding time infinitely easier- I don't have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hours trying to clean out stains. It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills). The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.  It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods! It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids. Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear. I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals. The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair. It will dry extremely fast and get really clean. If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is. We LOVE this smock and just ordered a second one for my daughter.
+1	Waterproof - toddler spill proofThin enough so it doesn't impede child's mobilityThick enough so it doesn't break or snag easilySurvived machine wash at regular cycle; hung dry in 10 minsEasy to close yet hard to open by a child so they can't just pull it offFits my 3 foot child to about the knees more or less so great coveragePerfect size around the neck
+1	PROS:Colors are bright and eye catching! Extremely cute!Keeps EVERYTHING off of my daughters clothes!!!Does not seep through!Easy to rinse! In the sink and hang dry!Drys quickly!Less mess in your kitchen and to have to clean up!CONS :Cant think of Anything YET! Will keep you updated!
+1	We own five of these smocks.  We started off with one when our child was about nine or ten months old. I loved it so much that I progressively added to our collection.  Our child is now almost three years old.  These smocks have been machine washed in cold on gentle cycle in mesh Woolite laundry bags and left hanging to air dry overnight more times than I can count, and they all are still in wonderful shape.  The necks and wrists have held up wonderfully.  We use these at every meal and with any snack that runs the risk of being even mildly messy.  We also use the BabyBjorn bib over the smock--although I have a suspicion that my child will soon stop agreeing to wear the bibs.  I hate to think of what my child's clothes would look like if we did not use these smocks.  My child was one of those toddlers who managed to get food everywhere--including on her elbows and under her arms.  We also use these as art smocks when we use finger paints, paint with water, and water colors.  They are great for that purpose.  I would qualify that only by saying that if you have a messy painter who is older and taller, this smock obviously won't cover all of the child's legs.  My girl is about 40&#34; tall, and she sometimes manages to get paint on herself from slightly above the knees and down.  This isn't an issue for me because I change her into play bottoms before she paints.
+1	We bought 3 of these smocks for our 5 month old for mealtimes.  It it is a great product and we found it particularly helpful in keeping our baby's clothes clean.  We now use it for our now toddler's art class.  Long lasting product.  And we washed them a lot !
+1	When you have a messy eater, this smock can save you from a lot of mess and trouble!! My baby girl wears this smock everytime when she eats something very juicy (e.g. watermelon). It works perfect!!
-1	I love everything about this chair...except that it's totally unusable because the middle strap is way too short!  I read another review stating the same opinion, but I'd already ordered my chair by that point and figured maybe they just got a wonky chair.  Nope.  My son is 13 months old, above average for height but average for weight, and there's no way he can sit in this with the buckles fastened.  The middle strap barely reaches far enough to even access the buckle (since, for some reason, the middle strap is attached in the MIDDLE of the seat rather than closer to the edge).  When I was finally able to buckle the side straps into the middle, the side straps and buckles were cutting into his innner thighs so badly he started screaming!  This chair will be going back, which is unfortunate because I love everything else about it and it was a great price!  It could've been such an easy fix if only the manufacturer either made the middle strap about 3 or 4 inches longer, or just moved it so it was closer to the edge of the seat instead of the middle.
+1	This chair works as described in the write-up & keeps my 2 yr old grt neice in her seat as it should during meals and such. It is very easy to unfold to use, pls make sure you have fastened this chair to main table chair to ensure the child's saftey while they sit in it. It is also easy to clean after use and to foldup to be stored after use. The chair also works well to be used as a child's chair to watch TV or play games. I would highly recommend it!
+1	Got this for my son for his first birthday and he/we take the poor thing everywhere. My son LOVES it because its his size and he can pick it up and move it himself. His sippy doesn't fit in the side pocket though, but that doesn't bother him or me.
+1	This is such a easy to use booster seat and is awesome for the travel trailer as it can be used outside arround the fire and then on the bench seat for dinner! The only negative I have found is that the crouch strap in the center is too short so we just dont buckle our 2 yr old in.
+1	Great find! Had no problems with the straps. Small enough to take anywhere! Used at a stadium seating event, the beach, park, home etc.
+1	This chari is VERY convenient for carrying around.  It fold and is light weight.  Also, it ties securely to every seat we have used.  The down side is that the seat is made of cloth, so the baby sinks in a little and it is not always the most condusive seating position for eating.  Putting a towel under our daughter has helped prop her up.
+1	This chair travels every where with us. We take it on picnics at the park and even packed it in our bags when we flew over seas. Small and compact when folded, yet study. My daughter just loves it! She now has a chair of her own.
+1	My baby loves the change pad. He loves having his diaper changed and as soon as I place him on the pad, he starts getting hyper and happy. It's soft enough and I like the straps in case I need to grab something near by (don't leave baby strapped by himself though).
-1	After 12 months, our changing pad has cracks all over the plastic surface of the changing pad, some as big as 2" in length.  I suspect in a couple more months we will have to change the pad, once the padding starts to come out.  Very disappointing.
+1	Get a nice cover for it and a diaper pad and you're ready to go
+1	This is a great memory foam changing pad, but unfortunately it does not fit my IKEA brand changing table and is about 2 inches too long and an inch too fat. I plan on cutting mine to fit though. Very comfortable and well made.
+1	The pad is nice and thick with a waterproof covering and good non-skid backing.  The boppy changing pad cover fits perfectly.
+1	We've had ours for a few years now and it has taken a beating.  We often don't have the cloth cover on it and as a result the kids have torn off the cover revealing the foam padding in spots.
+1	This changing pad is great.  You can take it when you're visiting people and won;t have to worry about finding a suitable place to change diapers.  The contour and strap will keep baby in place to make everything easier and safer.  I got this for a friend's baby shower and she was thrilled.  It's worked great for her so far.
+1	This is a great changing pad.  The contours on the side keep the baby from being able to roll around, making for easiest clean-up if the baby has a messy diaper.  It is extra long (34 inches), allowing for baby to have extra head and feet room as he/she grows.  If you buy this product, be sure to buy covers that have adequate length to accomodate this changing pad, though.  I use the ultra plush ones, and they fit well.
+1	Great padding that was essential when baby arches her back thereby slamming her head on it.  It is a standard sized changing pad--the covers I purchased fit perfect.  It has a textured bottom to prevent slipping.  I know they probably have to put that strap on it for liability reasons, but I removed it permanently (I think it hindered the traction on the bottom and I'm not walking a way from my kid on the changing table anyway, and it would only get in the way of changing diapers/clothes!).
+1	Simple, basic, functional.  As indicated, the pad comes with strap that can be screwed onto your changing table, but once our twins got too wriggly for the pad on the table, we moved it to the floor.  It has a low enough profile that it can just slip under a bed, or a sofa, and be stored wherever you find you change your baby the most!
+1	This is huge, but a really  nice change table to put on your bathroom counter if you don't have any room for more furniture in your house. It's really convenient to change baby right by running water too.
+1	We purchased this changing pad with our first son and placed it conveniently on top of a dresser along with a wipes warmer and all the other essentials - diapers, extra wipes, in the dresser itself.  The changing pad itself is very lightweight and the slip proof bottom worked well enough for us to not screw it down or anything.  It could be moved, but it didn't really slip.  We also bought two cloth changing pad covers by summer infant but these were not truly needed.  They may have made it more comfortable, but required a more difficult cleaning for accidents, which tend to happen with a newborn boy.  The pad itself is made of waterproof material and any accidents wipe straight away.
+1	I bought this item andBasic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Sage: great fit. The cover allows easy use of the safety strap, which by the way also comes with a screw, so you can screw the changing pad into your changing table or the wall.
+1	Good size,very durable,easy to clean but it's good to buy at least one change pad cover.The only thing I don't like is that the smaller sides of the pad slope down towards the edges so the baby hates to lie down with his head lower than rest of the body.
+1	the only reason i took a star off is because when we originally had the carseat rear-facing, we didn't really know what to do with the flap that goes against the seat. it will not stay up by itself, so we just folded it in half before putting the carseat in to keep the flap from falling onto the baby. not a big deal, just something to consider. we really like the mat and it is definitely great at protecting our new car from dents in the leather from the carseat. we even had a baby throw-up incident that seeped into the carseat and through the bottom, but miraculously this mat kept everything off the seat of our car. very easy to clean as well!
+1	Perfect for leather seats. The pockets in the front is a nice addition. We put the car seat manual and spare pairs of toddler sunglasses. Good buy.
+1	We bought one of these for my car because I was concern that the car seat would damage the leather in my car. We liked it so much that we bought a second one for my wife's car even though her car has cloth seats. It really helps keep things clean, and prevents crumbs and liquids from going into the seat cracks. The front pocket is convenient, and the 2 in 1 feature means this product will be useful for years. We have the car seat mounted in the middle back seat and the cover does kind of cover the seat belt anchor for the rear passenger seat, but its easy enough to find once you know to lift the flap.
+1	This is the only carrier that my daughter would use and it was by far my favorite.  It is super easy to sling over your shoulder and fit your little one into without a lot of prep or finagling.  It felt very natural and intuitive unlike other carriers I tried.  Also, if the baby falls asleep while you're wearing her, you can lie the baby down on the bed and slip yourself out of the sling without waking her.  (It takes a bit of practice, but it is very do-able) I highly recommend this sling.
+1	I was a little worried about going cheap with a sling but I'm so glad I got this. The other brand names start out at $60 at least! My daughter is now 1 and we've been using this sling since she was 4 months. We both LOVE it! I've had no problems with seams coming loose and have washed it several times. I like the shoulder pad - provides padding without being too bulky. I've gotten so many compliments on it. Love it! It does require some practice and getting used to for both mom and baby so if you're having difficulties be patient.
+1	I haven't tried this with my newborn yet, but I used this sling ALL THE TIME with my other baby!  I had my last two babies close together (13 months apart), and toward the end was stuck with a baby who couldn't walk while I was in my very uncomfortable third trimester.  This sling was a LIFESAVER.  It has enough length/slack that I could put my baby in (she was about 10 months the first time I used it)and adjust the sling so that she was not sitting right on my stomach. It's also VERY easy to get on and off, especially off.  Removing a baby sling, whether a baby is in it or not, seems to always be the hard part.  This sling comes off easy as a wink, and if you have your baby in it, it's just as easy.  The padded shoulder is also a very nice perk, and it pads nicely without adding a lot of bulk.I am looking forward to using this sling again, and will be getting on the maker's website soon to see how to carry my newborn in it safely. I'd absolutely recommend it to a mom needing a sling.  I've tried several different styles and brands, and this is so far my favorite!
-1	My #1 complaint about this sling is not uncomfortable it is on my shoulder. It's the opposite of comfortable. I've used it in many different holds (newborn, on the side/hip) none of them were comfortable. Also the padding around the sides is completely useless and makes it more difficult to tighten through the rings. Don't waste your money!
+1	I love it, and a lot of people keeps asking me where did i get it. My 2 year old and i've had used these untill a couple of months ago, she's getting heavier for my back, but i still have it on hand in the closet in case i need to go some place where the stroller would be a hassle and i'd need to have my hands free.
+1	I researched a TON of slings & baby carriers before deciding on buying one! I didn't want to spend $100 on one and ultimately decided on trying this. I almost bought the Moby, but decided against it cuz I was a little intimidated by all the wrapping and wanted something to quickly get off and on.I LOVE the style. It's gorgeous fabric and the open tail on the end is enough fabric to use to cover up baby's face if you're nursing, or if you're outside and you need to keep the sun off for example. I have not personally used the sling to nurse baby though, but I'm thinking you probably could.I've only used it for one hold...the one where the entire baby is in the sling (as a newborn to 6 weeks). It does take just a little practice to get the baby positioned just right in this hold because you definitely don't want to just &#34;plop&#34; baby in there...you need to keep baby from bending his head down too far to his chest. It worked because I could put baby in there and actually get a few things done around the house...and eat lunch! It didn't allow me to do household chores that required bending over though...like loading the dishwasher, doing laundry, things like that. I also couldn't do dishes or get too close to the counter tops with the sling on because the baby was at the same waist height as the counters.It's been nice to use while shopping in certain places. I have found that if I go to a grocery store, it's much easier to keep baby in the car seat, and stick the car seat on a cart. And if I'm doing some mall shopping, it's easier to put baby in a stroller. This sling has come in handy when I need to do a shorter shopping trip in a store or place that doesn't have carts...like Kohl's! I just stick baby in the sling, and shop away. I can easily take if off in the dressing room if I need to try some clothes on.As far as comfort, it has a really wide, padded shoulder area where it sits on. It doesn't hurt my back at all. After awhile (like 15-20 min or so), it does cause just a tiny bit of discomfort over top my shoulder, but I can easily reposition it some (with baby still in sling), and it helps.I'm looking forward to trying new holds now that baby is getting older, so I will have to update later!
+1	This is the best baby carrier I have tried and I've tried a front carrier, moby wrap, and pocket sling. I love the infinite adjustablity of he ring sling. My LO is quite the squirmer, so it is great to get her in place before cinching it down. The padded rails are great, and it really is light on the shoulder! Carrying my 20lb baby in my arms cramps up my bicep in a pair of minutes, but i barely feel her weight in this. It is a wonderful sling and so affordable! I would not only recommend this to all of my friends, but it for my friends if I could!
+1	I have been using this for about 2 months now, since my baby was a newborn.  I LOVE that when I put her in it she feels secure and I feel confident that I can use my hands for other things, like lifting my 2 year old, without worrying about her falling.  I also love that there are many different ways to carry her....I am just figuring out carries for breastfeeding and again, I love being able to do this hands free since she usually wants to eat when I am also eating.  It is a bit difficult to tighten at times because of the padding but that is nothing that &#34;ruins&#34; all of the other pluses of the carrier
+1	I've been using this sling for over 1 year now. Baby gets excited as soon as she sees it bc she knows she's gonna be on mama or papa. I can still (at almost 20 mos) walk her around and BF or put her to sleep. The material isn't as soft as other slings I've seen, but considering the amount of times I've washed the sling, that's actually a good thing bc it still looks brand new. Regardless, the baby looks comfy in it and she's never complained of being uncomfortable.I have 2 other carriers, the Moby and the Beco. The Moby was good while she was a little baby, but it was cumbersome and too hot for the weather in south Florida. I also love the Beco, but the sling is so much easier to use for shorter periods of time.
+1	I have several baby carriers and I prefer my Mobi wrap and my Infantino Flip because I feel they are more secure, but this one is great for the hip carry.  My daughter jerks back a lot though, so I still always have one hand on her at all times.  I like it to carry her around when she's cranky and I don't need both hands to do something.  It's great for going for a walk, but not when you need both hands for something else like pushing a stroller or carrying groceries.  If your baby doesn't jerk back, then it's great!
-1	I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck). I prefer the "real" carriers though. I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone.
+1	This thing is GREAT. Better than the Snugli or other items similar to that. In the sling, the baby's entire body, not just the trunk, is cradled against you, sort of like in the womb. It actually looks uncomfortable for the baby, but mine sleeps quite soundly in it.Not only is it comfortable for both you and baby, there's enough material to provide a covering for nursing, unlike the snugli types.It also provides mom with hands-free mobility.And it's SO SO SO much better than lugging around a two-ton car seat! The baby is quite secure without additional support of any kind. It does take some getting used to. It took a while to figure out the right position for both carrying and nursing. So if you buy one, don't be discouraged if you can't figure it out right away. You'll love this thing!
+1	A friend of mine gave me this sling in the pattern "Fern (Batik)" and I used it right away. My baby loved it. I decided to purchase a second one in "Indigo" so that I can accessorize. It is so affordable compared to similar slings, but you are really getting a product of great quality. I feel confident putting my little one in it because the rings hold the fabric in place without slipping. This sling is as beautiful as it is functional. The shoulder padding is also really comfortable. The one drawback is that the instruction booklet is less than clear on how to properly do the cradle hold, and there isn't a decent picture of it, but the sling itself is wonderful. I ended up looking on youtube for videos on how to use a ring sling and never looked back.
+1	This sling is great.  I struggled with getting it just right at first.  However, there are great video clips and demos on their website that help you figure it out.  I haven't attempted any ambitious positions like carrying my squirmy 7 month old on my back but the hip position and side craddle for nursing have been great.  Being able to walk around freely while my son nurses is such a wonderful help.  He isn't being rushed and I am not constantly searching for a chair or bench in public.  I do NOT consider this a hands free baby carrier.  You really need to keep one hand on the baby.  However, it makes it alot easier to carry my baby, who is nearly 20 lbs, without breaking out the Bjorn and strapping us together tightly.  The Bjorn is great for truly hands free hiking or something of that nature but it gets hot and uncomfortable on both mom and baby.One side note:  I was so psyched to use it that I didn't wash it first.  This was a mistake.  My son has sensitive skin and he broke out with a moderate to severe rash on the exposed skin areas that had direct contact.  He does have issues with eczema and is generally more sensitive than the average baby but just making folks aware.  Wash this thing in Dreft or another baby friendly detergent first.
+1	I love this sling when I need a quick and easy option for carry my baby when I'm out and about.  It fits her better now that she's older (4.5 months) than when she was tiny (I preferred my moby-style wrap then) and it's comfortable for me as well.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the amount of threads that are left at the end of every row of stitching--a higher-quality product would have gone back to trim these, but instead there are little 1/8"-1/4" left overs all over it.  It doesn't detract from the appearance unless you're up close and picky like me, and it's not unraveling or affecting the functionality--but I keep meaning to go back to it and trim all over.  Lovely color though, and overall I enjoy this product =)
+1	While other carriers may be comfortable, they are a headache to put on. This one you just slip on, but the baby in and close the velcro.  I have not found it to be good for long-term wear, but great for around the house and on short trips to the store. Also, it not good for a tiny baby. Maybe 15 lbs and up?
+1	I bought this for my infant but it did not work out well for us (got the Moby instead) but once she was 6 months it has been an easy way to have a free hand while doing laundry or walking to the mailbox, without having to "get all strapped in." I think this is a must have for an older baby for quick uses--where you just need 1 hand. The pattern is fantastic by the way. Very nice.
+1	Maybe not ideal for an infant, but after about a month, it works remarkably well. And it doesn't look like a SWAT vest, which is a plus in my book.
-1	My baby never fit in this properly and I tried at different ages. The fabric is cheap and scratchy. Spend the extra bucks and get an Ergo or Moby.
+1	I use this for quick trips with my infant. If I were to be carrying my baby for a long period of time, I might use a different carrier that's supported by both shoulders, but they take forever to get done up. This one just slips over your head and baby fits in easily. I use it to go outside with her and I even walked around the farmers market the other day quite comfortably. I still keep at least one hand on baby for stability. If you're going to be taking your baby in and out of the carrier, ie when visiting friends or a restaurant, this carrier is great. And...the price was reasonable. I'm glad I got one and recommend it to others.
+1	This was my first sling and my first experience with baby wearing. I registered for this for baby #1 and a friend gave it to me at my shower! My baby is now 8 months old and I've been using this since he was 3 days old. The sling has come in handy so many times at the store, at church, in class, on walks, in restaurants, doing household chores, and "just because". :)  (I uploaded a few pictures so you can get a visual).I love that this ring sling is both practical AND beautiful! I got the fern batik print and love it. The fabric is very durable, and the shoulder and rails are nicely padded. As some mentioned, the padded rails can make tightening the sling a little difficult at times, but once my ring sling was "broken in" a little, the padding softened and it's become much easier to adjust.This is a great sling for those new to babywearing or who want to test out a ring sling without spending $50+! Some of the slings I was looking at are upwards of $100 - while I would love to someday have such a high quality sling, this one does the trick nicely for now. :)A few tips and techniques I've learned:#1 - Positioning: SAFETY FIRST! Please be sure that your infant is positioned high enough for you to easily ensure he/she can breathe easily, especially if you are wearing your newborn! "Close enough to kiss" is what I always read. It can be a little tricky sometimes to get your baby up this high, but I found that if you tighten the sling a little more before putting baby in, it's easier to maintain that visibility.#2 - Don't pull on the "tail". When you go to adjust the sling, don't pull down on the little tail to tighten things up. This makes it hard to get the proper fit. Instead, pull each side/rail individually UP and across your body, until things are snug and positioned correctly. You'll probably have some extra poofiness at the end of the sling and it won't end in a nice sleek little tail, but you can always wrap the excess around the rings after you've adjusted. :)#3 - Spread out the back! Make sure that the shoulder padding is spread out nicely across your shoulder, not bunched up at the neck, owch! Also make sure that the ring sling fabric is spread out nice and wide across your back, and that it's not twisted. Spreading out the fabric means a much more comfortable carry, and it won't stress your back so badly.#4 - Switch sides! Be sure to wear the sling on alternating shoulders so you don't over-fatigue one side of your body. I admit, I didn't always do this - because of breastfeeding complications involving an abscess, I couldn't have anything pressing on my right breast where I had an incision, so I would always wear the sling on my left shoulder, keeping baby more toward the left side of my body. Once I healed, I went back to switching shoulders.#5 - Grab a friend and keep practicing! It was helpful for me to have my husband there to help me spread the fabric in the back and across my shoulder, then to hand me baby so I could put him in the sling. If you're having trouble initially, ask someone to help you til you've got the hang of it. Everyone's body is different and every baby is a little differently shaped, so it'll take you some time as you figure out the most comfortable position for you, and the best positions you want to use for your little one.#6 - Don't give up!!!  There is definitely a bit of a learning curve in babywearing, and this sling is no exception. Your muscles will take a bit of time to grow accustomed to the extra weight so you might be a little sore (if you're really really sore tho, look into your positioning and technique as things might not be quite right in that area!) Do your own research and look up how to wear your baby safely. I watched YouTube videos, read tutorials, and did tons of good ol' Google searches on different positions in the ring sling (newborn, cradle carry, hip carry, forward facing, etc.) Above all, have fun with it and don't get discouraged if your first few attempts are less than "perfect"! Before you know it, you'll be whipping your sling on like nobody's business. :)
+1	I did a LOT of research on baby carriers prior to our baby being born. These are expensive, so it matters. And I think carrying your baby is easy, convenient, and keeps everyone a little less fussy. Each one has a niche, so I wanted to make the right choice. Being a spring baby, we opted for the bjorn air when she was little and have an ergo for when she gets a bit heavier. But I was still missing something. My baby COULD sleep in those, albeit very uncomfortably. I wanted something she could nurse in and sleep in that would give me at least one hand free. I work from home sometimes so feeding the baby while working kills two birds.My only hesitation in buying this was it was so cheap. Every other ring sling I'd considered was 2-3X this sling. But I'd already invested in two other carriers and the reviews were positive so what the heck.This is exactly what I wanted and more. It's great for around the house for nursing or sleeping. It does have a learning curve,  and I'm still learning - but I have some basic holds that work for us. This is also great for sitting up and facing out. It's so versatile, on a recent trip I took this one carrier and used it for everything.*best use for me: nursing on a plane. We've taken quite a few trips and I was originally holding her and using a nursing cover. Well my arms would only last about 30 minutes. With this I get complete privacy and when she falls asleep she's in the sling - hands free! When the plane lands if she's still sleeping I can get up and go. If she wakes up I just sit her up and face out. I love this thing!!  It's also so much more tailored looking without the tail. I'm tall and slender, so I have a small tall to work with if I really need it.It's pretty comfortable. The padded shoulder definitely helps. I find this no more or less comfortable than other carriers.Cons - ring slings in general seem a bit more feminine and so my husband won't wear this one (but doesn't mind the ergo and bjorn).The fabric I ordered was a little rough when it arrived but it's getting softer with each wash.
+1	This sling has been amazing for going back to work. It's great for nursing hands free so I'm able to work at my computer. I can even lay baby down in his crib or on his nap mat with the sling and pull my head out when he falls asleep. I also have theMoby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Almond Blossom, and theBABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original- Gray/White, Mesh, but really prefer this sling. It's much cooler to wear than the Moby, and easier to get in and out of than both the Moby and the Baby Bjorn. The sling is very convenient for running errands and getting baby in and out of the car multiple times. The only drawback for this sling is that it's not as comfortable as the Moby for walking longer distances. Of course, probably the most important factor is that my son really enjoys riding in the sling. He's four months old, now, and we've been using the sling for work and errands since he was a little over three months.
-1	I had hoped to use a sling but I ended up with a different papoose that I love. It seemed my baby wasn't ever comfy in the sling, it also made my shoulder hurt. I ended up returning this product.
+1	This sling is the best! I have 2 of them and I use both all the time. I have been using it since my son was 3 months old. He is now 6 months old. I can put him in it in multiple positions and breast feed him in it when walking around. I get lots of compliments and people askng me where I got it. If its raining out I put him in the sling and the umbrella keeps us both dry and baby warm. I can't say enough good things about this sling.
+1	I had a moby and a maya before I ordered this one. The Lite-on-shoulder fit to my body better, and was light weight and easy to slide through the rings. Which made it a quick slip to put baby in and do any adjusting. It is comfortable to wear for a long time and doesn't get hot! I LOVE that the end is stitched nicely so you can literally thread it while holding your baby on your hip. There is no &#34;set up&#34; ritual. You just throw it on and go!
+1	The sling arrived quickly, and I was pleased with the quality of the fabric.  The instructions that came with the sling were not great, so I went to You Tube and found many videos about sling wearing.  Watching a few videos gave me more confidence in the use of the sling and ensuring the safety and comfort of my baby.We have been using this sling for about two months and baby and I are very pleased.  My baby is clingy and likes to be carried, so she really enjoys being in the sling. It makes doing tasks and shopping much easier while she is content and both my hands are free.  It is much more comfortable than my Baby Bjorn (which I still use), but it is not as quick to get her into.  It does take practice to use the sling, but once I used it a few times I felt much more confident about it and I find I am using it more often because it is comfortable and baby loves being able to look around and also to look at me and cuddle with her head on my shoulder.I would recommend this sling, the price is great and it is just as nice as many of the more expensive slings I looked at in some fancy baby boutiques in my area.
-1	This thing was so cheap and so narrow, it wasn't even functional for my 6 week old. I returned it immediately. As soon as I put him in it, I heard a seam splitting (he weighed about 12lbs!) I ordered a REAL ring sling from Etsy, and use it all the time. Don't waste your money.
+1	Overall, I like this sling. It's fairly comfortable and easy to use.PROS: Strong, quality fabric. Nice fabric design. My son can sit in it comfortably (I bought the sling when he was 6 months old), and it seems like he should continue to fit in it comfortably for at least another year. Maybe longer.CONS: The sling feels a bit bulky. It can be difficult to slide the fabric through the ring to adjust it.  However, I suspect that some of my gripes with bulkiness and adjustment may be due to my size (I'm 5'2&#34; and slender). Also, it sometimes slides around on me, and I'll suddenly notice that the shoulder part is digging into my neck, so I need to adjust its placement periodically. But when it's on me correctly, it's comfortable.
+1	I have tried the Mobi wrap (which is like working with Rapunzel's hair) and the snap on carriers; both drove me nuts! The wrap was long, couldn't put it on in public places, had too much material for my size and the snap on carriers were bulky and uncomfortable. This is the first ring sling I have ever used and I am in love with it! The biggest pro is that it takes two seconds for you to put over your head to wear it. I don't have to try and rush wrapping 50 yards of fabric around my body or try to reach snaps while I have a baby screaming at me. I am a foster parent and right now I have a 3 month old boy and a newborn girl; this helps me tremendously! I can shove this in a small diaper bag perfectly!*One thing I will mention is the first five times I tried it I felt like I was doing it wrong. The video's didn't help me, I just had to keep trying with the baby in different positions until we both got used to it. The 3 month old loves it! The newborn is so tiny that I am afraid to put her in yet.
+1	I love this sling. My husband and I used a wrap carrier when our daughter was tiny, and he tends to use a structured carrier when he wears her. She's fine with that, but if I use the structure carrier she gets really cranky and cries. I think it's because she wants to nurse and she's shoved into my chest. This sling is fantastic because I can wear her on my hip or even tummy to tummy without her getting cranky. The padded rails are awesome because her little legs aren't dented too badly after wear, and the padded shoulder feels great. My daughter is still only 15 lbs, but it's incredibly comfy to wear her in this sling. I think I'll start baby-wearing more often because this sling is a great fit for us.
+1	I've tried a few carriers and my 2 month old would just get so frustrated and cry the whole time and I could never figure out what was wrong or how to make her more comfortable. This one won her over. Not only is it comfortable for her but it is for me as well. There's plenty of padding in the shoulder for me and in the edges for her. I tested it out with her at home and we walked around for 30 min with NO TEARS! I'll be keeping this one for quite some time, I'm sure.
+1	This sling works much better than other styles for my newborn. I did get a sit in style for when she is older but this one is great until she can hold her head up on her own.
+1	This fits perfectly over my Keyfit 30 seat.  I love it!  It solves the problem of dressing my son for the weather.  I don't want him to be too hot in many layers of clothes, but he needs to be protected from the cold!  I can snap this right over his car seat while he's wearing normal clothes and be ok.  In colder weather, I put a blanket on him underneath it.  It is great wind protection!
+1	I live in Massachusetts and wanted to make sure I could keep my baby warm when we went out. I looked at the BundleMe, but then read that it's not recommended by car safety experts because it sits between baby and the car seat bottom, somehow compromising the seat's performance in a crash. So I went with the CozyUp instead, and am very happy with it so far. It goes on very easily. I thought the head opening might bother my baby, having the fabric so close to her face, but it doesn't seem to. Getting her in and out of the carseat isn't any harder, and I feel confident going out that she is warm. I recommend this to other mothers.
+1	This is a fabulous product!  You can dress your child in LIGHT LAYERS, especially good while riding in the car.  Simply zip-it up to keep child nice and cozy from the wind and cold.  It traps child's heat remarkably well, so again don't overdress your baby when using this product.  It works like a sleeping bag.  And I love that it doesn't cover my daughter's head!!The other products on the market look like they could be a suffocation hazard!  REALLY, I saw a mom at the store with the 'other brand' and when she pulled back the cover to reveal her little bundle I was shocked and mortified someone would actually close their newborn up in it.So, needless to say I think this is not only a wonderfully designed and functionally sound product, but it is fool-proof for some parents.The only downfall I have is I can't fold the top neck away from my child when not using it in the car.  To me it kind of gets in the way.  However, it has been a true life saver this winter and I'm very thankful to have received it for a baby shower gift. (Go Grandpa!)
+1	I like this shade, especially since my lightweight stoller has a joke of a shade.I only gave a 4 star because there were really no instructions.  You have to play with it to figure out how & where to connect the straps.  But once on it usually stays in place.I also like to pockets on the side, convient for holding bottles, keys & small toys.
+1	I recently bought a jogger and like the majority the shades on them they aren't sufficient for shading your little ones eyes.  Someone in the review for that stroller had bought this too and was pleased.  This was so simple to put on, can pull it down even further when heading directly into the sun and has pocket storage on both sides of shade wich was a bonus.  A very inexpensive way to extend your stroller/joggers shade and the uvb blockage is even better.  Love it!
+1	If you're reading reviews on this product then stop and place the order. You will not regreat it. This is perfect. I haven't met a Kiddopotamus product that I don't like. Your babies skin will thank you for this product. It fits perfect on the Chicco travel stroller and stays on when you fold the stroller up. A MUST HAVE in my book!
+1	This is very simple to use and I'm happy I didn't spend a fortune on the others! It's very efficient and has lights that are activated by the baby's cries - in case you're in a noisy environment - like the garage - and cannot hear well. I keep one of the receivers on my headboard and while I keep it on the lowest volume setting I do hear a bit of a buzz. So I turned it off during the night. I'd definitely buy this again.
+1	I originally bought a much fancier baby monitor that quit working rather quickly.  I did my research the next time around and got this one.  It is very clear, no static and has a good range.  I love that all three units can be plugged in and you're not having to spend a fortune on batteries.  I bought this in 2009 and now- at the end of 2012- it is still going strong.  I highly recommend this baby monitor!
-1	I was unable to use these as expected because of static.  One had low-level continuous static and the other had loud static.  It unnerved me listening through the static and I simply stopped trying to use them.This was a regrettable purchase, a waste of money.  I don't recommend this product.
-1	I bought this set hoping that despite the low price, it would work based on the reviews on this site. Well, not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house. I really like the light sensor option on the front, and wished these would have worked out for us. And yes, battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day, before they went out. I'll be returning this back to Amazon...
+1	This is the second monitor we have owned.  Our first monitor we paid a lot of money for and had all kinds of problems.  We decided to go with a more affordable one so if it broke we would not be out a ton of money.  I am blown away by how great this monitor is.  First off you get two receivers which is totally handy.  The range is great and they have a really clear signal. Way to go Graco!
+1	Excellent little monitors. I've had no problem with static despite the number of electrical appliances running in and around my house. The sound is very clear and I rarely have to turn the volume up higher than the minimum. The light meter is very accurate and defines between baby noise and other noise (radio, fan etc.) well. I've read complaints about this model that you can't mute the sound completely which is true, but I don't know why you'd want to do that anyway, you might as well not bother having a monitor if you're not going to listen to it. Amazingly for such quality it's one of the lowest priced monitor sets on the market even at full price, and can often be found on sale so you really can't beat it.Edited to add: Units seem very durable. I have dropped one of the units several times while using it as a portable and it still works fine, the battery cover has stayed in place and the casing hasn't chipped or cracked. Note: I've seen these priced at anything up to $100 from independent retailers. Be careful and shop around as they should sell for around $30.
-1	This monitor always had a lot of static in the background. Sometimes it would not even work because of the amount of static. And now I havent even had this year and it doesnt work at all. A piece of junk! Save your money and buy something useful.
+1	I love this monitor.  I was hesitant to get it at first because the price was so reasonable but I went for it and have had no problems at all.  The reception is so clear that I can hear my son breathing in his crib.  I also love that it comes with two receivers.  I keep one in my bedroom and one in another part of the house.  I would definitely recommend buying this product...don't waste your money buying something more expensive.
+1	They have a lot of static, but you don't need the volume cranked up to hear the baby - I could hear him pretty clearly whether he was crying or quietly babbling to himself.I did pick up another monitor on one of the channels. Keep this in mind if you have neighbors with babies. Since the monitor has two channels, I just switched to the other one (and turned the monitor off after naptime so the neighbors couldn't hear my singing/TV/what have you).They still work after a year, and I haven't really even taken very good care of them - they've been loose in suitcases, they've been yanked off of shelves and fallen on hard floors.
-1	This is the first time I've reviewed a product on Amazon, which should emphasize how strongly I feel about this product. It was a gift from my mother in law before we were even registered (therefore, I did not pick it out myself). I will start by saying that it serves it's basic function. If my baby is crying, I can tell. But I would not trust it if I were sleeping in one room and she were down the hall in her bedroom (she is still in a bassinet). Unfortunately, I have found this monitor to be VERY noisy with a lot of static/feedback. Not only is this really annoying, but I can't hear small sounds my baby  makes. As a first-time mom, I want to hear EVERYTHING. It does have the light function to indicate sound, but there are always 2-3 of those lights lit at all times due to the static in the monitor itself, so again I can't tell when my baby is making noise. As a result of all this, I do not trust the monitor and am constantly running to check on my baby myself which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I currently have the Summer Infant Day & Night handheld video monitor (best selling video monitor on Amazon) on my wish list. Can't wait to get rid of this one!
+1	It's all been said I think - these work amazingly well and I haven't second guessed this purchase once for use in our baby's room.  The ONLY annoyance I have with them is the power indicator light which is pretty bright.  We just taped over it and problem solved.
+1	this is a great diaper pad. sure it's not fancy, embroidered, blah blah blah. but it's small and fits all the necessities for a short outing. and if you have someone to watch your stuff while you run to a changing station, you can take it out of your gigantic diaper bag and only carry the little bag. and the zipper compartment can hold a couple of plastic bags for chucking #2 diapers while out and about. if you want to save some money, go with this.REVISED ON 5/29/09: i had no idea that the price went up to over $14!! (i got it at an embarrassingly low price that i cannot mention...) still it's cheaper than other brands. also. if you can get a better wipe dispenser from a hospital swag bag or something, switch it.
+1	I love this portable changing pad!  I get so finicky and weird about changing tables...I think they are gross!  What I love most about this changing pad is that it is made out of some material that allows for it to be cleaned so easily.  You just wipe it with a cloth, spray some Lysol and viola! you're ready to go, again.I do not choose to put my diapers and wipes in it.  It doesn't fit well in the diaper bag that way.  I prefer to keep my diapers and wipes out of it so I can arrange things a little better.  I think that when the baby gets older, perhaps once she's reached a year, it will come in handy as I expect to be able to ditch the diaper bag but will still carry this with diapers and wipes folded up into it.  It is good, and I will definitely keep it around for the next kiddo.
+1	You'll need this, for the diaper changes. Safely place the diaper, then the baby fold, hold and tuck. Great product, nice quality of material. Has storage place for few diapers and wipes (wipes are inside a supplied plastic container) and very, very useful while travelling. Only caveat, as the material is synthetic on top, in cold climate - placing the baby on it, welllll he/she might not like it! Could have had a cloth cover on top.
+1	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).
+1	I bought this to replace the bad changing pad included in my diaper bag. I won't disclose the name or brand of that diaper bag because that's not what this product review is for. This product review is for the First Years Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit.They call it a kit but it's really just a foldout changing pad. There's a small zippered pocket with a place for those wet wipes but no one buys it for the zippered pocket. We bought it for the pad.It folds nice and is a great color for The Boy. The only issue is that the day after we used it for the first time we went to a thrift store and found the same product for half the price. It was used, but by that time so was the one we had just purchased so we could have saved a couple bucks.But that's not the product's fault, that was just a digression.
+1	I don't want a diaper bag so I bought this to hold wipes & diapers in & then just store it in my purse. It works amazingly & I never have to worry about my baby girl lying on a dirty surface or her dirtying a surface.
+1	We've used this everywhere, including on the floor of some pretty gross bathrooms! I love that the wings fold in before it rolls up, keeping the surface baby lays on clean, even if you can't get to cleaning it until you get home!
+1	I hate diaper bag. That huge nursery looking sag will be always with me? Hell noooooooo!!!!!  But i needed something that holds few diaper and wipes. This deluxe fold and go is amazing. Everything i needed. It holds 3 size 3 diaper. 1 travel case ( huggies) wipes diaper rash cream ( mustella). In that zipper bag i put my credit card cash and my keys.And its a good 6 hours outside.  I am breastfeeding mom so i dont need anything besides my fold and go. 10$????? You cant beat the price. Just 2 cup of frappucino price something useful for long time.
+1	We bought two of these, one for each of the baby bags (my husband and my own). This wrap works great for changing the baby in public so the baby does't have to be on the icky changing tables.  Still folds up a reasonable size even with the little wipe case and two diapers stored in it.
+1	Gets the job done. I can store 1-2 diapers, the wipes case, hand sanitizer bottle, and diaper cream with no trouble. I recently took it on an airplane trip. It was way easier to take this little kit than a huge diaper bag to the cramped plane bathroom. My husband likes how compact it is too.
+1	I got this as a baby gift when my son was born. I absolutely loved using this changing kit! It folds up so easily to fit into the diaper bag and was perfect to take into restrooms when we were on the go. It was comfortable for my baby to lay on to be changed. It also was nice to have on vacation. The kit comes with a container to store wipes in and has a holder for that inside the kit. There is another pocket that can hold around 3 diapers inside it. You have everything in your reach! There is also a zippered pocket on the very front of the kit to hold other things. It folds up nicely and is held together by Velcro and doesn't come apart if you don't want it to. I would so recommend this because it is so handy and saves a lot of room in the diaper bag!!
+1	functional roll up with good storage.  not made for cheap plastic either.  sown well together, though it has stretched from over stuffing it.  easy to clean too.
+1	It is very easy to carry and very practical too. I can keep a couple of diapers and other hygiene items inside the bag.
+1	I use this regularly as part of my diaper bag. It's great! It's a fairly decent size for changing baby, it's nicely padded, it can hold diapers and wipes easily, and the green color is so vibrant and fun. I love it!
+1	Very useful, convenient, and has a pretty pattern. It could use a strap of some sort to hold the entire thing shut. Velcro is not great.
+1	Compact size when folded with just the right compartments for what you need.  Fits easily in my small diaper bag and I can fold and unfold with one hand with the velcroe closure.
+1	I actually bought this at Target in green, but it is an absolute MUST.  My diaper bag didn't come with a changing pad, and I like this one because it is much easier when you are out and about to grab this and run into the bathroom then to have to lug the whole diaper bag in with you.  I don't use the little black plastic wipe container it came with though but that is my personal choice, there is nothing wrong with it, I just slide a half empty regular wipes refill in there and it fits just fine.
+1	I love how this folds up and stays folded in the diaper bag. It is great that the wipes stay put inside. I find this item convenient and of good quality. I am glad I purchased this.
+1	I bought this for my father-in-law who watches my son during the day. He's been pretty happy with it. As with other brands, it would be nice if it were a bit longer. Most changing pads are meant for smaller children. My little guy is just now 2 and is 36.5&#34; tall, so his head and body won't fit on this at once.
-1	I had an older version of a First Years diapering kit that we loved. We lost that one somewhere and I bought this to replace it. It's pretty, and compact, but it's just too small. It only holds two size-4 diapers, and I have to struggle to fit those in the pockets. The wipe case is fine, but I'd really rather be able to fit a small package of wipes in the bag, rather than having to fill the little plastic box with them all the time. The changing pad is small too. Overall, not really useful for any baby older than 6-8 months, I think.Edit: We went with the Skip Hop changing pad, and it's much better for fitting things into. Still not as good as the original First Years kit that I lost, but much more usable than this one.
+1	Initially I did not think I would get a lot of use out of this.  Boy, was I wrong!  It seemed like every time I went into a restaurant/store/church/party without our large diaper bag in tow, that was the time I ended up needing it.  So this was the perfect solution.  I keep it in the car at all times and just grab it and use the velcro strap to hook onto my purse or the baby carrier or toss in the stroller.  So convenient!  I like that the changing pad is a generous size, and because it has the folding flaps along the side (not just a straight rectangular shape) it's nice to keep baby contained and prevent them from touching yucky things around them.  The color is cute too, I opted for the black/green as it is very neutral for future babies.I ended up liking it so much, I purchased a 2nd one for the babysitter to keep at her house for times when they have to make a quick errand, etc.  It's a lot easier than lugging around a diaper bag.Overall, I think it's a great item, and the price is certainly right!  If you are a parent who finds yourself on the go and not wanting to have to carry an extra item (since a purse and a heavy baby & carrier aren't enough already!), this is perfect for you!
+1	This product is the perfect size if you're not going to be out all day long. It fits 2-3 diapers in size 2 (up to 4 in newborn size) in one inside pocket and has a wipes case for the other.The wipes case is great, I would say it holds about 20-25 wipes, and it's of better quality than the name-brand travel case I was using in my bigger bag. It's a good thing they include the wipes case too, because other travel wipes cases I have seen or used would not fit in the mesh pocket of this product.The outside pocket is convenient for a limited number of small items (for me it's usually phone, keys, chap stick, money/ID) but doesn't fit much more than that. It has a strap with velcro so it can be attached to any number of items (stroller, etc.) which is also nice. The changing pad wipes off quickly and easily, and is a good shape and size.This kit is so convenient to use when you just need the necessities. I love it, and use it all the time when I don't want to lug around the whole diaper bag. An added bonus is that women who carry large purses (which may be more fashionable than some diaper bags) can just drop this in their purse as well. Also, of all the kits I have seen out there, this one is the best when considering price. The only one I've seen that I like better is 3x as expensive.The only thing I would change about this kit is to have a little more space in the outside pocket, which isn't a really big deal. I mean, in order to do that, the whole product would be bigger in size, and the small size is one of the things I love about it.
+1	We bought this as a Christmas gift for my son who was 5 months old. We had no problem filling it (as others have) and just pushed down on the plastic part while holding under the faucet. My baby loved the mat, but it leaked all over. I tried lots of different things, but it leaked out of the valve you fill it with. I returned the item to Amazon who replaced it after I mailed the old one back. The new one actually arrived before the old one could have reached them, and the new one does NOT leak! My son loves this mat and spends a lot of time slapping it and watching the toys move around in the water while getting his tummy time in (which he used to HATE!)  I'm glad I gave the product a second chance, and I'm also glad I purchased it from Amazon who made it so easy to exchange it.
+1	Bought this to use for my 3 months old tummy time. She doesn't particularly like tummy time so I was hoping this would help. It is a cute product, and she tolerates it for a few minutes, but not long. Only complaint is that it is a bit of a pain to get the water in.
+1	Both of my kids love it!  I just get nervous because my son (6 months) keeps trying to eat it. :)
+1	My twins LOVE this toy. I credit this with helping them both become excellent sitters because it held their attention for long periods of times and helped build their core strength. I can't say enough good things about this toy.
+1	My son hates tummy time and until I got this item he would cry from the moment I put him down for tummy time until I picked him up.  It was really a struggle for me to encourage tummy time when he disliked it so badly.  This item has improved the quality and enjoyment for my son.  He now rolls over to his tummy on his own to play with the mat.  The product is simple to use and effective.
+1	I can not tell you how many of my friends have bought this for there kids after seeing it at our house.  Great for tummy time to crawlers.  And I have had no trouble filling it with water or keeping my cat from it. Love this toy.
+1	When my son was younger I was always trying to figure out things for him to look at during tummy time and my dayare teacher recommended this since she has it for the kids there...and I have to say it is awesome....a little hard to fill but that so it won't leak and it never has and he would eventually roll and sit on it and nothing ever leaked.  When he used it for tummy time he could push on it and the items moved...his head would follow them....he enjoyed this toy very much.... I highly recommend as a shower gift or for any mom who wants to give their child something to do during tummy time.
-1	The idea behhind this mat is great - give your baby a different texture and visually interesting things to explore during tummy time.  However, the actual product was a bit underwhelming. First, without the assistance of the reviewer who explained how to fill the water portion, I'd likely have assumed it was just broken, as there's no instructions and no clear way to fill the inner portion of the mat. Once explained, filling the water pocket was very easy. The mat is pretty small - my 9 week old could not fully fit on it, but he did seem to enjoy the different sensation. After 48 hours the air had leaked out of the outside ring and the fish in the inner ring were being hunted by the cat. We move it to higher ground but an additional 48 hours later and it had spring a leak.
+1	Our kid likes it.  The outside air-ring doesn't hold air but I don't think that matters at all.  The inner section is great for slapping and poking for a baby and it is fun to lay on the floor with him to play with.  If our house blew away in a hurricane, I'd buy another one.
+1	I would recommend every new mom get this.  It makes tummy time much more interesting for the baby, and I also put him on his back on the water mat, too.  So great to diversify tummy time.
+1	My son started to like this mat around 4-5 mos. He's 8 now and is still entertained by it. Our 45 lb bulldog pounces on it, runs across it and stands on it multiple times daily, I can't believe it hasn't popped...is a tough little mat!!  Have recommended to multiple friends, and the price is right on Amazon! (I bought at a local toy store for about 40% more).
+1	my son will sit and look when I move my hands on it; he likes to lay on it and feel the cool water; he likes to smack the fish during tummy time; best toy i've bough hands down!
-1	This was a bit of a pain to fill, but the real issue was that it broke after a few days.  There was a hole somewhere in the outer lining, so it didn't hold the air.  Too bad, becaue it's a cool concept.
-1	I got this for my four month old who hates tummy time. It helped him like it a little better, but he often prefers to just lie on a play mat or on the carpet. My main complaint is that it smells very strong, like a pool raft. It smelled terrible when we first got it out of the package, but now we've had it for a month and it still stinks (not as strongly though). When my son gets tired of holding his head up, he lays his head down and mouths the mat. It smells so strongly of chemicals that I don't want him to do that, so I have to constantly be right at his side ready to put my hand down so he can't mouth it. It'd be a great product if it weren't so chemical-y, but I barely use it.
+1	Our daughter truly enjoyed this during her tummy time period. We have since given it to a friend who has a little one, and she loves playing with it when we visit... perhaps I was too hasty in giving it away.
+1	I've had this things for like 7 months now and it STILL hasn't leaked despite very rough treatment (my kid stood on it, jumped on it, etc), so ones that leaked are faulty.Who would need instructions on how it fill it?! It has a hole and a plug. Run water into the hole. I never thought twice about it. That's like needing instructions on how to blow up balloons. Put it in your sink and run water into the hole... I'm not trying to be rude, I'm really not, I just don't get how that isn't obvious and easy.Is it an amazing, spectacular toy? No. It is a neat toy that is fun to smack and jiggle and squish? Yep. And it was totally worth the $10.
-1	Wanted to love it, but the smell was horrendous, and then I think our cat walked on it. Dead within a month.
+1	My son absolutely hated tummy time.  I have tried absolutely everything to get him to spend more time on his stomach, but nothing worked.  I know how much I love water, and hoped that my son would as well, so on an impulse I bought this item.  I'm very glad I did because now my son participates in tummy time.  He doesn't scream and cry anymore.  I'm so happy that I had the whim to buy this product and I would recommend it to any parent who struggles to give their child tummy time.
+1	These are great for babies and tummy time! I like the concept but the quality could have been better. Maybe it's just the one I got.
-1	Although my child thoroughly enjoyed this product, I believe it's probably safe to assume it contains BPA.  Also when my child punctured it, I called the company, and I was told they couldn't help me. They wouldn't even send me a repair patch. My baby didn't even have teeth and he punctured it.  On that note, I tossed it in the trash.  I really thought it wouldve lasted longer.
-1	This is a great IDEA but ours grew mold almost immediately so I couldn't let our infant daughter use it.  She has developmental delays and never wanted to do tummy time so we wanted to see if this would interest her enough to lay on her belly.  Didn't get to use it long enough to see.  It was also very hard to inflate.
-1	Very stinks! Water flows!Pour difficult! Plastic toys inside, heavy and bad swim.  Thrown out money. My child played 5 minutes and more do not want to watch. It is poison! Because it is - then the child periodically go face him and licks is chemistry!
+1	Ideal for a 4-8 months old baby. My baby used to hate tummy times but now she keeps on playing with this water mat and doesnt mind being on her tummy plus even if her head hits the mat she's all good cause of all the water.So she gets to play with water and I get no mess.. One star less cause I couldn't blow the outer surface on my own needed my husband to do that so bit hard to blow it up.
-1	Unfortunately this didn't last very long in our house.  I noticed it was leaking a few months after we bought it.  But I wasn't too disappointed because my baby didn't really love it.  Definitely not something I would purchase again.
-1	Not really worth the little bit I paid for it.  It had a tiny hole in it where the plastic folds met.  My 4-month old HATED tummy time, and I was desperate for anything that would stem the wailing - even for a minute.  She was distracted by the colors enough to be quiet for a moment, but once she realized she was getting wet she would freak out.  On a related note, if you're having this experience, keep at it - she eventually loved tummy time (around 5 months)!
+1	My 6 month old got this for Christmas, and she likes to play with her fishies! Was a little hard to get the water in but it hasn't leaked so it's worth the trouble.
+1	This is going to be a Ideal gift for my little grandaughter for her 1st Birthday. She is going to just love it !This was a great price for the quality & quantity for such a great playset.I would highly recommend this to all my friends or family
+1	This little cake is Adorable! I love all of the little items inside, I think it's a lot cuter in person!! It's perfect for little fingers to pick up! I think I am going to put my Son's birth photo in this when I give it to him for his first Birthday!
+1	Bought this for my daughter's first birthday.  Nice educational toy and good for her Physical and occupational therapy as well.  I recommend to others.  Everything fits nicely inside the cake.  My only surprise was how small it is.  It's smaller than I had assumed it was.
+1	I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday and she simply LOVED it. The set was adorable and she quickly became obsessed with the teddy bear because when pressed, it plays the classic Happy Birthday tune. All the pieces are perfect for babies, mainly because they each have a different sensory element that most babies enjoy. Squeaker, crinkles, and rattles will keep babies entertained and happy.It must be noted that this toy is smaller than most people expect, but keep in mind, this toy is meant for babies and thus is sized accordingly. At the regular retail price, it's far too expensive and overly priced, but I purchased this for 75% off w/free ship and it was perfect, so if you are interested in this, try and see if it goes down in price if you have the time. Personally I feel that this toy, although super cute, shouldn't be priced anymore than $15 MAX, mainly because of it's small size. Other than that, it's a great purchase and one that would be greatly appreciated by the child and their parents because it can be put away as a cute keepsake.This would make a cute first birthday gift or even a simple keepsake baby shower gift for boy or girl. Gund is known for their quality and it shows here. On sale, it's a great purchase and I highly recommend it!
-1	I got this because I also purchased 2 other items from Tiny Love and thought very highly of the concept behind their products.  Unfortunately, I read many reviews about this having a tiny mirror, hard to install, and difficult for the baby to reach....well, I really should have listened to all those horrible reviews....this sits in my car but isn't hooked up or anything.  I put my old car mirror back up & just gave up on this product.  However, the other TINY LOVE products I bought were AWESOME & I would highly recommend them (musical arch & car seat mobile)...I guess not EVERY product from a company is going to meet expectations.  Please listen to all the negative results on this one & don't buy it.
-1	I read such wonderful reviews of this mirror, that I couldn't wait to get it.  My baby is only 2 1/2 months old right now, and I find this mirror an irritation.  It takes 2 people to get the mirror placed so that the driver can see baby's face (one person in the back seat and the other in the driver seat).  The smiley face on the frog takes up valuable space.  When trying to get baby's face positioned in mirror, the smiley face frequently cuts straight through baby's face, making her facial expression impossible to see.  Hubby and I worked for 20 minutes to adjust this mirror so that Baby's face was visible from the driver's seat.  Once the baby's face is visible and the frog's smiley face is around the area of baby's neck, the picture is warped so badly that I feel like I'm watching the movie Alien.  I CAN see if baby's head is in the proper position and see if baby is smiling or frowning, making this semi-functional when mirror is placed right.  The biggest problem is that when someone sits in the back seat next to baby, they may touch the hand or foot of the frog as they are buckling themselves in.  If they do, then it moves the mirror and the quest to get the mirror placed correctly starts all over again.  I give this 2 stars because I expect as baby grows, her legs will be long enough to reach frog's belly, and she may find the toy interesting to play with.  At that point, I seriously hope I don't need to see her in the mirror anymore.
+1	We began using the Munchkin deluxe bottle brush when our daughter was born about 5 years ago, and still use it today even though our kids (5 1/2 and 3 1/2) are out of bottles and sippies.  It is still very handy for water bottles, water bottle spouts, etc.  As long as you use common sense (don't leave it standing in water, shake it out, etc.), it is very durable.Pros:  Only brush we have used that doesn't spray when in use (like crazy), tiny nipple brush has many uses for water bottle spouts, etc, suction cup keeps it standing up automatically, attractiveCons:  noneI have read a lot of the negative reviews and just don't agree with them.  After having used many bottle brushes for baby bottles (we used mostly Avent and BornFree), we never had an issue with these brushes.  They were a life and time saver.  All in all, highly recommended!
+1	This holds up well! Ours has been used every day for the past 6 months and it is in great shape! Fits the ottles and nipples perfectly!
-1	I have been pleased with a number of my other Munchkin purchases, so I decided to get this bottle brush to replace one that I have overused. Unfortunately, this brush is not useful for us. The blue bristles are so stiff that they cannot get into the corners of bottles. For some of the bottles, the brush hardly fits into the mouth of the bottle at all (4-5 oz storage bottles from the hospital, and regular Dr. Brown's bottles). And, there is no way this brush can be used at all on any pump parts. The white bristles are actually more flexible, but since the blue bristles are at the top and bottom, it makes it virtually impossible for the white bristles to get into corners. We have toyed with the idea of cutting off most of the blue bristles, but that is pointless.The &#34;nipple&#34; brush, which is at the base of the brush, is slightly more useful, but there is a bent over piece at the tip of this brush, which makes it slightly too large to fit into some parts. Also, these bristles are also quite stiff, but this part of the brush is still more useful.I would recommend getting another brush, like the Dr. Brown's bottle brush, instead. They also sell tiny nipple brushes. Both of these items are more useful than this Munchkin one.We have been using this brush to wash vegetables.
+1	I love this brush. The included tiny brush works great on my advent bottle nipples. I love how the nipple brush acts as a stand for my bottle brush so the bottle brush never has to touch my questionably clean counter!The 360 degree cleaning reaches the bottom of the bottles quickly. Tip: Super hot water melts the breast milk off the bottles with ease.
+1	its affordable, cleans well. If it rust just buy another one.  I love how it stands up alone . GREAT SUCTION. Wish I had purchased this brush before I shelled out nearly 10.00 on my previous one. This one is cheaper and it still works the same.
-1	I actually purchased this from a local retailer after I had worn out a different brand of bottle brush.  I was very dissappointed upon using this brush. The bristles are stiff and difficult to fit into the neck of my standard size Dr. Browns bottles. When I pull the brush out of the bottle, soap suds spray everywhere (sometimes forcing me to re-rinse items that I have washed and layed out to dry). This new mom does not appreciate the extra work. I would rather use this to scrub my own cups rather than the baby bottles. I gave it 2 stars. The first star is for sturdy construction... the second star is for the handy suction base. And those are the only good things I can say about this brush. Maybe I will have better use for it when the baby moves on to sippy cups? Or maybe for a Magarita party? But then it shouldn't be called "BOTTLE" brush, should it?!UPDATE- 1 year later and I still hate this Munchkin brush for bottles. It works very well at scrubbing kids plates though. I took a tour of bottle brushes after this. I recommed the OXO bottle brush. It is so much better at cleaning my baby bottles and is a much better design with the stand and small parts brush!
+1	I have tried several other kinds of bottle brushes & this one works best for me.  It fits well into most sippy cups as well as the Playtex Drop in bottles.  The nipple brush is great for cleaning the nipples, which I do by hand every day.  It only lasts a couple weeks with heavy daily use (the nipple brush is first to go) so it would be awesome if there were replacement nipple brushes.
-1	The brush bristles are SO HARD! I was using this and in my mind I'm just going, I feel like I'm using a toilet brush not a baby bottle brush. Even my dad asked me if I bought the wrong one! And I have to tell him, I got this off the baby section!S*** I think a toilet brush may even be softer!I can't even get the whole brush in with out using full force to force it in. And then pulling the brush out causes the soap suds to fly all over the sink, counter and on me!HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!Def. going back to the OXO Tot baby brush!
+1	I bought this for my son's sippy cups because the large brush came with the small brush to get inside spouts, straws, etc.  I didn't realize that the small brush fits up into the base but at least it keeps them both together.  The suction cup is a nice idea too.  This is a nice thing to have even without kids.  I find myself using both brushes all the time.  I often have a vase with fresh flowers and can't reach my hand inside my favorite vase.  I used to shove a dish rag down inside the vase with a long handled spoon but this works better.  And sometimes I will use the brush to scrub the bottom of pots and the little brush to get into crevices.  The little brush is really great at getting inside the newer silicone spouts on toddler cups and under the silicone lip where dirt collects.  And we live in a humid climate where mold can start growing very fast.  So this is good to have and it isn't too expensive.
-1	Pros:The nipple brush works great and it's nice that there is a suction cup on the bottom of the bottle so it can be stood up to dry.Cons:The bristles on this bottle brush are very hard so it's a huge mess when trying to scrub bottles. Soap/water gets sprayed all over when trying to remove the brush from a bottle. VERY annoying. Also since the tip is all stiff bristles I don't feel the botte gets as clean. I prefer the bottle brush that has a sponge on top - it just seems to clean better.Note:I wouldn't buy this brush again but if you choose to; I suggest you use a little dish underneath to catch all the run-off, Otherwise you'll have a little puddle on your counter each time you use it.
+1	Great bottle brush! Even includes a micro cleaning brush in the handle for little hard to reach crevices in bottles.I love that the brush head is so stiff as it really scrubs the bottom of the bottles well.Definite must have for any parent who is bottle feeding!
-1	We have the OXO bottle brush at home, but my mom purchased the Munchkin brush for her house.  We were visiting her for a week and I could not wait to get home to my own brush.  The bristles are tough on the Munchkin brush.  The softer bristles on the OXO brush allowed me to get into the crevices of the nipple, thus more effectively cleaning the bottles and nipples.OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange
+1	This is the best bottle brush! Worth every penny!It has lasted longer than any other one I have ever bought & it does not have the sponge like the other brushes. It works great, stands on its own which I find practical and sanitary. It cleans extremely well and the nipple brush attaching right on the bottom is very convenient. Just love it!
-1	I get sprayed in the face every time I pull the brush out of the bottle. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Is it possible to mess it up? The best part is the smaller brush and the suction thingy.
-1	I can not recommend this bottle brush. Its very stiff, very abrasive, and very (amazingly) difficult to use. Unless you're using very wide mouthed bottles you can't get this brush OUT of a bottle without spraying soap and water everywhere. Its stiff enough that I often question how effectively its really cleaning out the bottles. Its about as stiff as the brush we use to scour dirty pans!!! There's a trick to using it that we've mastered after having it a while, but come on... its a bottle brush. There shouldn't have to be a &#34;trick&#34; to using it!We'll be shopping for something better and dumping this one ASAP!
+1	I love these bottle brushes, this was my second one.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and has a suction cup bottem that keeps it upright by the sink.
+1	I really like this bottle brush. I have gone through a few brands but this is by far my favorite. I do not use the nipple part as my son no longer uses bottles but they are great for his sippy cups and even my cups. Easy to sanitize through the dishwasher. Love this and if I have another child this will definitely be my go to brand.
+1	Best bottle brush that we've used thus far.  We had one that has a sponge on the end and really that was kind of squicking me out with the idea of the dirty sponge going in to clean my baby's bottle.  But this brush ended one, I feel like I can get clean when rinsing it out.  The little nipple cleaner on the end of the handle works well for cleaning nipples and getting in the nooks and crannies of the breastpump parts.
+1	this is a good brush the bristles are stiff enough and spread out enough to do a good job, the bottom has a smaller piece for cleaning nipples.
-1	This bottle brush has bristles that are so stiff, it is hard to use. I like the design and the way it stands on the counter, but functionally it isn't very good. I ended up replacing it with theOXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange, which has soft bristles and really cleans well without tiring me out.
+1	These brushes are much better than the ones with the sponges on top.  The sponge ones rip after a week.  These brushes last and last.  Also, I love the nipple cleaner it comes with.
-1	the center of the brush is way too wide in diamater and does not fit in any pump parts, it also has a hard time going through certain baby bottles. the vactum idea is great but that is about the only positive thing about this brush
+1	I've had this brush for well over a year and it still looks brand new. It suctions perfectly to the sink. We didn't end up bottle feeding much at all so this brush has been used mostly for dishes. Now, I even use it for pots/pans! I just run it through the dishwasher to clean it. When/if I need a new one, I'll probably get this one, again.
-1	Would give this zero stars if I could.  Every time I wash a bottle, this brush flings soapy water everywhere--all over the sink, counter, and my face!  And the nipple brush is way too thick and the bristles are too hard.  A double-sponge bottle brush is what I had before (a sponge tip and sponge at base, with bristles in between), and that's what I'll be going back to.  And by the way, the tip of the nipple brush rusts right away, as other reviewers have mentioned.
-1	I bought this at Target but it is the exact same brush.  After using it for only two weeks I just purchased the OXO bottle brush with stand on amazon's website.  I had the OXO brush before but needed to replace it.  I happened to have spotted this one at Target so I just bought it thinking I liked the suction stand.  The stand is great but the bristles are way too stiff.  You have to use a lot of force to pull it out of the bottles.  I have the glass Life Factory ones and the heads are a bit smaller than most.  Still, the brush should not be so stiff that when you pull it out of the bottle you knock over something else because your arm goes flying from the force of pulling so hard.  Amazing to me that no one even tests these products before they hit the shelves.  Do not purchase.
+1	The larger brush is excellent and fits into the nipple though not quite all the way into the slimmer part but it does a great job changing shape to fit into smaller parts. I thought I did not receive the nipple brush only to realize from the other reviews that it is in the larger brush and can be located in the base.
-1	The brush is stiff and I feel I have to force it in the bottle. The bottles I use are the 5oz medela and the evenflo glass bottles.I also feel like it doesn't generate a lot of suds.  I definitely cannot use to clean the medela breastshield.  The brush is too stiffto fit inside and clean it throughly.
+1	I've had these with all 3 of my kids and love them. Also have given them as baby shower gifts!
-1	This brush is huge. The size is a positive because it cleans the whole surface of the bottle. However, when you pull it out of the bottle the bristles cause soap to splatter everywhere. The bristles are very rough so it does scratch the bottles.The nipple bristles are firm enough to clean well. I also like that the nipple brush is longer than the recent nipple brushes I have seen.  The suction does work well. One major negative about the nipple brush is the wire that it is made out of is rusting at the tip.I would not purchase again.
+1	This perfect for cleaning bottles. The nipple brush you do have to be careful with it or you can easily poke through the nipple since the metal is exposed that holds the bristles. I use the bottle brush to clean the nipples and have zero issues with it.
-1	I bought several of these brushes because we go through them left and right. Afer 10 months of using them...I  have decided that I do not like them...at all. The nipple brush uses a metal wire...which rusts after about a month or so. The lengh of the brush is just a little too short. To wash an 8oz bottle is a little difficult because once the brush is fully in, there is only about 1-1 1/2 inches of the handle to hold on to in order to clean the bottle. Even with having smaller hands...this makes it hard to twist and clean. If you put the nipple brush back in and try to twist it...it doesn't work because the nipple brush doesn't "lock".
+1	This brush is sturdy and convienent. The nipple cleaner that attaches to the brush is great and always easy to find. The suction works well- and it stays on my counter. Great and essential purchase.
+1	I like the suction cup base.I've ordered this 2 times now, colors may vary.I've gotten pink both times (I was hoping for blue).But these are disposable, so it wasnt a biggie.
+1	I have tried every type of gate out there, and this one is by far the best. It is more secure and stable than ones that actually screw into the wall/banister. It says that it should not be in a place against drywall, but I have two (one at the top of the stairs, one at the bottom), and they are both secured against drywall and it's just fine. The gates look good too, most gates are an eye sore. My two year old could get past all other gates, but not this one, this would also be great for pet owners who have small to medium sized dogs. Highly recommended!
+1	Easy to install and works great for the price. Keeps my dogs at bay and my baby safe. I hate the bar on the bottom though and the opening is pretty skinny.
+1	I have 0 complaints about this gate! I purchased it from our local W*l-Mart for 34.97, and didn't have to wait for it to be shipped to me. I would suggest checking at your local store before waiting for it to be shipped. (Super-saver shipping takes forever) We use this gate to keep our Sheltie in the kitchen when she is eating, and to keep our 4 year old and our 13 month olds out of the kitchen. We love it! Perfect all around! Our 13 month old uses it to balance when watching me cook, and she shakes the door, hard, and it is just as sturdy as it could be! Opening it and closing it is very simple, and it has the "slam shut" feature, so you don't have to push the button and pull back the handle to shut it, that would be a pain. We will get many years of use out of this, considering it can keep our 4 year old out! It is just great!
-1	I just purchased this gate for my son to keep him away from my basement steps.  First of all the gate was not that simple to install, I had to go online to watch the video.  I dislike that the screws are not better constructed into the gate and the plastic that is used to extend them is not that strong, mine stripped under the presser.  The latch is not easy to open you have to use two hands which defeats the purpose of the latch being one hand slide.  I would suggest that you save your money and get a much better gate.  I plan on returning mine and getting the one that I really wanted but didn't want to spend the extra money on, I will know better next time.
+1	Nice quality. Thick and soft. Works fantastic in the pack n play and any place we lay baby we don't want a wet mess. Worth the money.
+1	This is the perfect pad for many uses and not just babies. Although I wish I had it when my kids were little since it is so multi-purpose.It is a great size, not too big, not too small. You can use it as a changing pad, a play pad or for those times that you want to take your baby's diaper off and let things air out but you don't want an accident to mark your bed or floor.There are many other uses beyond babies. If you've ever had surgery and you've had to sit on or lay a body part on one of those plastic, absorbent blue pads, you know how horrible they are at sticking to you. This is a great alternative. For those times that you may have 'leakage' during your period or seepage from anything, this is just right (although if you roll around a lot it may bunch up) but it is certainly good for a chair seat. It is great for an older person who is having trouble with leakage, especially for their furniture or vehicle seat.It washes up nicely and seems to be thick enough to hold a lot of moisture. But it is really soft as well.I was provided a sample for testing and review.
+1	This pad is fairly large at about 27 in. x 36 in.  The natural-colored plain-weave muslin organic cotton top is quilted in a Moroccan tile pattern.  The padding is polyester and the soft water-resistant backing is polyurethane-coated polyester.  The edges are serged.The pad can be washed and dried at cool temperatures with non-chlorine bleach only although I have washed it in hot water and didn&#8217;t notice any shrinkage or damage.It is very absorbent and will soak up a cup of water without any leak-through.  It is comfortable and large enough to be used not just for changing diapers or for a waterproof barrier in a bed, but also as a bed or carrier liner for pets or as a clean and soft surface for play- or nap-time for infants.  It can even provide protection for an upholstered chair when needed.A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.
+1	We love this pad.  It's soft, waterproof, and the perfect size.  We put it on our bed when our baby is on the bed with us.  We also use it for baby's naked time.  It's great!
+1	If you need somewhere to put your drinks, miscellaneous items this is what you need to buy. It firs securely around the handle.
+1	Good quality and fits relatively wide bottles. I have no complaints about the products. I only wish that, being an Idaho-based company, they would also manufacture in the US instead of China.
+1	This product isn't amazing, but it's worthwhile.I struggled to find something to use on the City Mini Double.  I kept coming across reviews for this.  It doesn't fit the city mini perfectly, but it works adequately.  It's a nice addition to the stroller so that we now have drink holders and a pocket to store keys, wallet, phone, or the like.  I don't know of a better product available for the city mini double, so I would buy this product again.
+1	This was given to me as a gift, and I really like it because since I have back problems, leaning over to help my baby walk was very painful, with this I walked upright, so that's much better. It's only useful for a month or two, but for people like me, a month or two of back pain is a real pain!!!
-1	The idea of this product is fantastic, the product itself needs help.I was looking forward to using this, since I am so much taller than my daughter and I have a bad back. I was hoping it would save me from bending over too much while assisting her to walk. The product seemed to raise up on her and would end up under her chin. It would help if there was a strap or something that would go between the legs rather than just go around the torso. The design is a bit flawed. She is starting to walk on her own now and we never did get any use out of this product. Wasted money, at least it wasn't expensive.
+1	I recently purchased this product for my 2 1/2 year old special needs son, whom refuses to walk.  He is happy crawling everywhere but does occasionally like to walk (when it is his idea) with an adult holding his hands.  I thought maybe this would be a waste of money, but so far it doesn't seem to be the case.  My son's face lights up when I put him in this.  He is so happy in this that he walks all over the house for 25 minutes before tiring of it!!  He could never do that with me holding his hands for that long!!  He has no balance at all, so I feel that this is definitely necessary for teaching him balance.  I noticed that having the straps adjusted very low and close to his back, make him more stable and he has an easier time walking.  Of course, I am hunched over, but who cares!!  He is loving it and I am hoping and praying that some day he will be able to walk unassisted!!!  I highly recommend this product for parents with special needs kids.  This is a must have!
+1	It is awesome, because my back says thank you... It is so convenient, I recommend so much... Really I do...
+1	This is a a must have to save your low back from bending over and you babies arms from being pulled on.
-1	it pulls baby's underarms kind of weird and it seems extremely uncomfortable for the baby; I never used it and I don't think I would ever do so I do not recommend this product to anybody.
+1	I wish I had bought this much sooner, but once I finally caved, I definitely think it helped my son gain the confidence to walk independently. It was barely used, though, so we're returning it. One thing to note: it's pretty small. We used it when my son was 16 months and it didn't quite fit around the chest (the buckles helped), and he's pretty average in size. I think this is a great product for a baby or toddler who is almost walking (cruising and using push toys) but not quite ready to be on their own. The only thing is that it helps so much you won't get much use out of it!
+1	When our baby started standing up, I held him under the armpits and helped him walk while supported.  It's not the most comfortable position to hold over the long run - for me or for the baby.  This harness distributes the support over his whole torso using a durable foam-padded soft wrap-around chest piece connected to nylon web belt and soft loop handles for the adult to hold.  The loops can be adjusted in the length to adapt to your height.  There are no pressure spots so this makes wearing the unit comfortable.  Baby can take supported steps while you hold him from above.  Our baby enjoyed this activity so we spent a long time each day walking around the house.  I credit this item for making this activity a comfortable and fun way to spend time with our baby and for helping him develop good leg strength.  We stopped using it once he was able to stand and support himself using a push-cart with wheels and used that to walk while supporting his body until his balancing skills developed.
-1	These bibs are tiny and poorly made - the trim has frayed and come completely apart after only two washings, and is of course synthetic. Save your money or spend a little more and get muslin bibs. There's no point in paying more for what end up being used as (supposedly) organic rags.
-1	The quality of fabric is very very poor. The material is fluffing and too much lints come out of it. Difinitely, causes the breath problems for infants.
+1	these are cheap but okay quality. Can't imagine how can it not fit on the back of any front seat, unless your front seat doesn't have an adjustable head rest such as a  racing car seat. There are many pockets, very useful for holding water bottle or other small items such as little toys to distract your kids while putting them in the car seat.
+1	love love love diono everything amazing quality. so happy to have found this !!!!!!!!!!! will buy another for other car
-1	I had this thing for maybe a month and the stitching came undone on the pouch. Also, it does not attach very securely to your seat so it just kinda flops around. The string on the bottom that you use to tie it to the seat is very flimsy and is always coming undone. Really dissapointed in this product.*Update* I ended up just throwing this thing away. I tried super gluing the pouch that came undone and that only worked for another month or so. I ended up getting the Munchkin one and it is great! Not only is much better quality BUT it is actually about 5 dollars cheaper! Don't waste your money on this one.
+1	This is a great seat protector.  Our son spilled a milk shake in the car and it dripped through the car seat onto the mat.  The mat saved our upholstery and cleaned up with a damp rag!  Great!  It is very thick and sturdy, and the car seat does not slide when placed on it.  It also keeps your vehicle seat from getting indentations from the car seat as well.  It also covers the whole seat top to bottom.  I accidentally bought a Kiddopotamus cover for our younger son thinking it was this one and it doesn't go all the way up the back of the seat to protect it from indentations from the car seat...plus it's not as thick as this one.
+1	We recently bought a new car and my husband and I are still in that obsessively cleaning the car phase and the rearfacing kiddo putting his feet on the seat back was bothering us. So this does the job of protecting the seat. I have two diono seats and two of these covers and it is just barely bigger than the carseat itself, so it doesn't do the best job of keeping crumbs and whatnot off the seats like I was hoping but that's fine.I will say the pockets at the bottom are not really usable for anything. We can fit matchbox cars into it but that's it. It's just very tightly sewn so there's not much give to put anything else in it.
+1	Great seat cover for when you have multiple seats or people in the back seat. It doesn't cover more of the seat than necessary.  It fits perfectly under the Diono seats without sticking out much at all. Durable and looks nice.  The little pockets in the front don't really get used but when my sons is a bit older and can sit forward and reach them, we may utilize them more. For now it serves the purpose of keeping my sons dirty shoes from touching the seat.
+1	Ive tested a few seat covers and none really worked well.. this one comes real close. It does its job in terms of covering the seat but it however fits a little loose on some seats and the tightening straps dont really do the trick. Its a solid investment and something that minor can be overlooked. It has no chemical smell right out of the box and the material works well with the baby carriers to keep it in place.
+1	Love this! Protects the seat and it is easy to clean. I'd recommend this. Plus, I like the mesh holder in the front.
+1	arrived on time. nice quality. heavy material. wide enough for my car seat. the only constructive feedback i have is the seat height, although i thought it would be needed, my car seat doesn't really touch the back so although, added protection, I'm not sure everyone will need it - car seat dependent.
+1	We have another brand mat car seat and they are both great at protecting our cloth seats from stains, dents, etc.  The pockets that hang down came up a bit short in our Yukon, but that could be the way the Britax car seat sits on the seat or the way my husband installed it; not really sure.  So, I have a hard time gaining access to the net pockets, but I don't use them really anyway, so it doesn't bother me.
+1	Love these. They do exactly what we wanted them to do. I like the pockets at the bottom. My only nitpick is that they don't cover the headrests of each seat and if you have a tall forward-facing carseat (like the Diono), the top of it presses into the headrest. If you have leather seats like we do, it will leave a pretty deep dent that the mat doesn't protect the seat from. Otherwise, great mats. We would recommend them and will definitely get another for baby number 3!
+1	We will be buying a second for our other carseat. The price can't be beat and it weathered the trip to Alaska, around Alaska and back. It fits our Britax Marathon easy. (Other bags are a stretch to house the Marathon.)This has nothing to do with the quality of the bag, but I do wish it was in stock more often. The two times I have come here to order it, it is out of stock. Last time I ended up ordering it from a different vendor and paying more plus paying for shipping. Please Amazon - get this in stock before the holidays!
-1	Our other car seat bag is the Eddie Bauer one. Getting a full sized carseat into the Sunshine Kids bag is as much of a wrestling match as it is with the Eddie Bauer bag; however, the Eddie Bauer bag is made of far better materials. We thought we'd take a chance with this since the Eddie Bauer bag is now tough to find and more $$$ + this Sunshine Kids bag got decent reviews. The EB one has held up to many trips where the people in baggage have dragged it across the pavement... The Sunshine Kids bag however did not. The bag was very worn, but not ripped after our first flight. When we attempted to put in the carseat for our return flight, the bag riped in the biggest wear spot. In fact, just the stress of trying to get the seat in the bag caused a rip nearly the full length of the bag. The airline had to put it all into a plastic bag b/c it was such a useless mess. So, all these people who left glowing reviews are just lucky...that's all.This product is a total piece of junk!!!!!!!!
+1	It's basically just a large, oddly shaped duffel bag. For the price it's still not bad, but don't expect anything special. There is no way to open it from the bottom as stated on the product page, but I don't understand how that would make packing easier anyways. There is a clip for the zipper which is nice in idea, but the loop from the zipper to the clip is a cheap, flimsy material that I can easily imagine tearing if caught on something. I'd be more comfortable with two zippers that I can lock together.I haven't used it yet, but will update after I fly in September.EDIT: trying to put the car seat in the bag in the airport while having to hold an 11-month-old in a carrier was a challenge. I was flying alone and in a hurry that I accidentally put the seat in the bag sideways. Oops. After the international flight and layover, the bag held up well except for one small tear that was actually caused from the car seat on the inside. I have a feeling it was caused by stress of the awkward placement. Otherwise it held up really well. I just wish the top was labeled and that the strap wouldn't get so much in the way.EDIT 2:I've currently gone through 4 flights with this bag and 4 more planned for this year. It's still awkward to put in, but I'm getting better at it the more I use it. Also, I haven't had any more damage aside from that small tear. It's surprisingly durable so far. Considering the other reviews about it tearing easily, I kinda expected it to be in shreds by now. Also, I have an Evenflo Tribute 5, if that makes any difference.Edit 3: I've gone through a grand total of 2 international transatlantic flights and 6 domestic flights (within the US) using this bag. It's great!!! Yeah, the design of the bag is a little difficult to work with, but it gets the job done. I haven't had any problems with any rips or tears since that first flight when I put the carseat in sideways. That tear (about the size of a quarter) hasn't caught on anything or gotten any larger. It's completely protected the carseat.  Also, the clip on the zipper has surprisingly held up really well.  The reviewers that had problems with it tearing easily probably should re-evaluate how they were using the bag and the type of car seat they were using. My son's carseat is a fairly standard convertible car seat with no accessories (like a cup holder). Also make sure the bottom of the carseat is in the wider end and either facing straight down or up, but definitely do not lay the carseat on its side inside of the bag. Because of how the bag is tapered, putting it in sideways will cause unnecessary stress and inevitably cause a tear. I have another international transatlantic flight coming up this fall and plan on continuing to use it for as long as possible.  I still wish the straps were placed farther down the side for better stability and to keep it out of the way when putting the carseat in, but I've gotten used to handling it.
+1	I took my son to the toy store to pick out a toy, and this is the item he picked.  He loves shaking things (he's 10 months) and it makes a pretty great sound.  The core of the frog is elastic, so when he's older he'll be able to stretch the toy a bit too for additional entertainment.  I like that the HABA toys are made in Germany to EU standards; it makes me feel better about him constantly putting it in his mouth.  I don't know how educational it is, but he certainly seems to enjoy it and it seems as though it will last a long time.
+1	I feel weird saying that it's only three-stars for education, because at four-months, isn't everything educational to a baby?Anyway, this toy is very cute, but it is small, so check the dimensions before you order if you're expecting something bigger.  It's a little expensive, but worth it to me. like the design and the bright colors.  My daughter enjoys chewing on wood, and I enjoy knowing that she's chewing on something made to EU standards, so it isn't nearly as likely to be toxic as her plastic toys from China.
+1	This adorable toy by Haba has lasted well through two different children and over 6 years of play. I love how Haba uses quality paint. It never chips (unlike Melissa and Doug).
+1	As an O.C.D. pregnant woman. I researched and researched and finally purchased four of these. Once i opened them i knew right away they were going to be amazing! The quality is far far better than the four packs you can buy for $14-20 at local stores. It is so easy to swaddle and actually holds. They look amazing. I love that the have sewn the "Swaddle process" on the blanket itself for my husband (when i have to run to the store). My absolute favorite thing about this (besides the amazing colors) are how big they are.  They will last far longer than the swaddle sacs you can buy. Swaddle sacs are great but they can only be used until they are too big. These will last much longer. I am about to order 2 more. I decided instead of buying $160-300 crib bedding set for them that comes with nothing you can ACTUALLY use besides a crib sheet. That these would work better
+1	LOVE this brand, really the whole line is great- the style is so refreshing no goofy cartoony stuff! Quality, softness, size, style are all A+ in my book.  These receiving blankets are also swaddles, and can triple as a lightweight stroller blanket, many uses for them- I have 4 different colors!
+1	We were looking for a heavier weight blanket to use for our newborn daughter last winter and this was it.  We live in the chicago area where we have very cold winters and we needed something thicker then some of the other cotton receiving blankets that we already owned.  We own several of the Aden and Anais blankets which are made of a very thin cotton which is good for the summer but we thought not warm enough for the winter.  We used this blanket almost every night to swaddle our daughter last winter and I really like that it is 100% cotton.  100% cotton is best for babies.  Other materials don't breath and can be itchy to them.  The only thing I wish is that it was made with organic cotton.  Other then that I think it is a nice thick and warm blanket for a young baby. Now that our daughter is 10 months old and it is getting cooler out again we have been using this blanket again at night!  It's held up well and I am happy with it.
+1	I bought this for my daughter before her birth, and it remained my favorite blanket. It's soft, warm, the color is nice and soft too, calming. It's easy to wash and no pilling.
+1	My son has been using this blanket since he was 2 weeks old. He is now 10 months old and it is still big enough to wrap him in (he is over 30inches tall and 25lbs). I use it as a modesty cover when nursing in the car. So many uses. It is incredibly warm, and I've even used it one winter night, when I had to keep watch over him in his room.Pro tip: if you are in a pinch for a towel, these make great ones! They are 100% cotton and absorb water like crazy.
+1	I ordered these for my newborn but when the package arrived it was marked as 3-6 months. However I received the exact same brand as a gift in the 0-3 month size and I have to say I can't tell them apart. I put all three next to each other and couldn't tell there was a size difference at all. They are hard to see when they fall on the floor but we keep it attached to a paci clip so that hasn't been a big issue. Overall I'm very pleased.
+1	I've tried a few different brands of pacifiers and these were hands down the best. I tried the NUK type and they kept flying out of my baby's mouth. She has done well with these since birth (she is now 9 months). She had some of the clear pacifiers and they were so hard to find if they fell or got misplaced. Try the colored ones. I highly recommend them!
+1	My baby enjoyed these very much.  The only pacifier she would take.  I like the clear because it goes with everything.  But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.  We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.  I still liked the clear, its unique.  Would buy again!
+1	I've been using these for over 2 months and have not found a problem. I love them. I bought the extra storage containers too. I have not frozen these but I like that I can freeze them if I want to. My system that works for me is that I pump into the bottles for use the next day. I typically pump more than my daughter eats, so at the end of the week I freeze any leftover milk (except for what I pumped on Friday, which will be used for Monday). I use Honeysuckle bags to freeze. I originally didn't want to use bags to freeze, but I realized quickly that would get expensive very quickly.- Sterilization is easy. I boiled everything (bottles, plugs, caps) for 10-12 minutes and experienced no melting. I also sterilized the extra bottles I bought.- You don't need the plugs for refrigeration. I stopped using them after about 6 weeks just to see if they were necessary. They are not. I've never had a leak and now it's one less thing to wash. I'm not sure if they are necessary for freezing.- The bottles only fall out the back if you "push" them into the unit quickly. Gently let them go in the rack so they aren't going high speed, and they won't come out the back.- I never had a bottle pop out the front. But I let my bottles go into the unit gently.- I've had a bottle go out of alignment on the unit and go down diagonally a couple times, but only because I wasn't looking and put the bottle in crooked.- If you take a bottle out the front and need to put it back, you can put it in the front and push the other bottles up. Make sure the unit isn't full.- They screw on to my Medela PIS Advanced pump perfectly.- You can store a lot more bottles of milk in this rack than just having them on a shelf in the freezer. It really saves a lot of space.- If anything, I wish it was a bit longer because my refrigerator is deeper than the unit, but I can't store anything in front or behind it.- Medela bottles KIND OF fit in the rack. They end up getting crooked so they don't really "roll", but they do fit. 4 oz. Doctor Browns bottles are the right diameter, but the ones I have are too tall to fit in the rack at all.- You can use standard collars and nipples with these (like the ones that go with the Medela bottles). However, my daughter had problems taking ANY bottle until we tried Comotomo brand so we still use those. Since the Comotomo bottles can't be pumped directly into, I pump into these bottles and use them purely for storage. Since my daughter is doing well on the Comotomo bottles now, we might try one of these with a standard nipple and see how it goes. If your kid will take a regular bottle, this is a HUGE plus because you can pump into, store, and feed all from the same bottle.To the people who've mentioned that they've had the bottles (especially caps) crack when dropped while frozen... that's a given. Every plastic bottle will have this problem. I have 2 sets of the Medela freezer storage bottles and I've had caps crack when dropped. The reason I don't like those is because they are only 2.5 ounces. You can't buy those caps separately either - I've tried. I even called Medela and asked for replacement caps but all they could do was send me a new set of 12 bottles and caps (which I very much appreciate, but my point is you can't just get the caps).
-1	I got this product and boiled it as directed to sterilize. I now have 10 bottles that are partially melted, same with the caps and the little inserts. Worst part of it is that I now have melted plastic on the bottom of my good pot!  I am still using the bottles to store milk, but not really happy with the product.
+1	I love this product.  It works great.  I would recommend purchasing 2 to have the maximum storage ability.  Great to heat the bottles up in as well.  Be careful not to over fill the bottles.  Leave room for the milk to expand in the freezing process or the bottles will split.
+1	I have used these bottles for about a year, and am getting ready to wean.  I used them for the first 5 months for storing frozen milk (I wasnt rotating them), then when I went back to work, I rotated in the frozen milk and started using the bottles with the rack to store milk in the fridge.  Like most others have said, this is certainly more cost effective than bags.  My daughter wasnt ever a big drinker, so I would use from 2 to 3 and a half a day, so stored about 3 or 4 days of pumped milk (with BF for the morning, noon and night feedings [daycare was next to work]).This also worked with my medela PIS advanced pump without any problems.  I didnt find cleaning the separate caps an issue, though Im not sure why they designed them this way to begin with.The one thing they could improve on would be to make it from the same material as the medela bottles.  I think they are both polypropelene, but for some reason, the fat on the medela would come off a lot easier than on these bottles.  Maybe because these have some texture to them?  Anyway, the reason why this is a shortcoming is that, because these are stored horizontally, there's a much larger surface area on the top of the milk than if they were stored vertically (which wouldnt work in the rack system, of course).  Because all the good fat rises to the top, then it takes a while of sitting on the counter and swirlling the milk to get this fat to off the sides.  It can take something like 20 minutes or so to get all the fat off the sides, versus with medela bottles where it may only take a couple minutes.I would definitely buy this, but recommend to the product managers to make this out of the other material.
+1	I was surprised to find that 10 storage bottles were included in this, as it was not very clear about that in the product description. I have yet to use them for quality, but thought the other was worth mentioning.
+1	I love this system.  My husband is a stay at home parent and he never is confused about which bottle in the fridge he should use.  I find the bottles attach to my Medela pump perfectly.  It doesn't take up much space in the fridge.  The bottles have never leaked, even after dozens and dozens of uses and runs through the dishwasher.  We have also found that the caps/nipples from the cheapo Gerber bottles fit on the MilkMate bottles without any leakage.The only thing is that the bottles only mark to 4oz.  Not a big issue for us, I just fill to the neck.  We also have never freezed these bottles so I do not know how they work in that situation.
+1	I loved this before I had to return to work. It was very convenient to be able to pump directly into the bottles. Not so much to carry them around, and giving the bottles turned into a bit of a hassle with the daycare. I would much prefer the disposable bags. it is also a little more difficult to thaw milk from these. The bottles are BPA free, which is comforting , and easy to clean, but I wouldn't recommend them for the purpose of a working mom, or to take out in public.
+1	No surprises here. They are screw rings. They screw, they work, I just needed more to go with my bottle system.
+1	I have only ever used the avent bottles and I love them. When you buy these, just make sure you buy the correct nipples!! There are two kinds of nipples. This ring is NOT for the Natural Newborn nipples!!! I made the mistake of buying those along with these rings and they do NOT work!!
+1	I have Avent bottles, but don't have the Avent pump (so didn't get storage accessories).  Instead of buying a storage kit for $25, this plus the Avent Sealing discs (total cost of $10), gave me the storage bottles I needed.  It works very well and I would definitely recommend.
+1	Great fit for the new event bottles. I use these with the caps for transporting bottles so I have no leaking.
+1	I purchased two of these gates. One for the entry way into the hallway and the other for the kitchen entry. Installation was very easy. I read the instructions and then watched the video as instructed. It does take a bit of adjusting to get it where the door closes automatically both ways as claimed. I found that actually measuring and ensuring both sides were equal distance helped the most. I find the dreambaby very practical and durable and hope it lasts. I am happy I choose to go with the extra tall opposed to the original size. The extra tall is the perfect height for my husband (6'3") and I (5'9"). The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the true test is whether it will hold up over time. Otherwise, it is 5 star worthy.
+1	This gate looks really nice compared to other baby gates I've used (I have the black one), was easy to install (we're using it pressure-mounted) and is easy enough to open for an adult but hard for a small child. I love that it's tall, as I don't need to bend down uncomfortably when I'm holding my eight-month-old. I ended up buying a second gate for another spot in my house. Buy this -- you won't be disappointed.
+1	This extra tall baby security gate is ideal for many areas where one would want a safety gate. It's quite strong as it's shipping weight of 20 pounds would imply (that 5 pounds more than the shipping weight of the regular Dreambaby security gate). This is super-easy to install on "some" areas because it's pressure mounting style is intuitive and doesn't require many parts. I am currently using  one and three of the regular Dreambaby gates (and two other different types as well).2 Words of Caution:1) This is probably not the best gate to install at top of stairs simply because you'd have to use screws and there aren't enough screw holes (just one for top and one for bottom on each side, and you'd really need twice that).2) The pressure mount is not designed for most situations where there is molding. For example, if you've got molding along the wall such that the little round parts that touches the wall cannot be flush, or if you've got molding on your bannister such that the round parts that attach there cannot be flush. Whereas the instructions say you have to have this gate touching the floor, there are places where you can get away with having it slightly above the floor. But decorative molding may make this gate too difficult to install without getting creative with well-cut pieces of wood or some other creative method.The included extentions:Dreambaby sells this product on Amazon with the extensions included, one for each side (you're not supposed to use two on one side although some people have done so with success). Whereas you're paying for the extension (nothing is free), it is a convenience especially when you see what all the gate marketers charge for an extension separately. As I mentioned, I have 3 of these particular gates installed. I used one extension on two of them and two on one of them. I cannot imagine what a pain it would have been to order the extensions separately. Of course, that means I have two extra extensions that I don't need.The operation of this gate:I love it. It's better than my other gates. The door closes shut automatically when you open it even halfway and let go. Very convenient. After all, you have to go through the gate over and over again everyday, and you don't want to make this event an ordeal.Top of stairs:Oh, how I hated installing a gate for top of stairs. This is the most sensitive place to install a gate. That's because a baby can push on it and go down the stairs with it if it fails, God forbid. Here's my recommendation for top of stairs:KidCo Safeway Gate - White. Just as I found the Dreambaby gate the simplest and best for most uses, I found this one simplest for top of stairs. But installing it was more difficult and time-consuming that it would be to install many pressure mounted gates. It has two screws for each of the 4 contact points. Guess what? - You really have to throw away those screws because they're too short and insufficient. So you have to get your own appropriate screws. Moreover, this one doesn't close and "lock" automatically like the Dreambaby gate. Please see my review on it for tips regarding installing it (or other reviews that have good tips).Conclusion:The pressure mounted Dreambaby gate is near perfect for non-top of stairs uses providing that there is not decorative molding to interfere with installation. Inclusion of the extensions was a good idea even if it drove up the cost a little. Operation of the gate is a dream.
+1	We bought this gate to keep our cats out of my husband's study - keeping the door closed in the hot summer months makes the room quite hot (with all the computers, etc.)The gate works wonderfully - the cats have jumped the shorter version (one of them hurting their leg in the process.)  The taller gate is just the ticket.  I recommend it highly.I've just picked up my second one of these gates to block the stairway at my new house (my cats are old and I don't want themwandering around the top floor.)With the addition of the recommended bannister kit, it took only about half an hour to set this up on the stairway.  I don't know if it is sturdy enough to keep children out, but it certainly works for my cats.
+1	We put this in our newborn sons room doorway to keep our cats out... they would like to jump into his crib and sleep in it.  As new parents we want the door open to our sons room so we can hear him and not worrying about our cats disturbing him.  The gate is very tall and impossible for them to jump over.  Plus the gate seems like it will be good to use once our son is able to walk we can use in other spots around the house so he doesn't get into trouble.
+1	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a "stay open" feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.
+1	This product seems excellent so far; we have only had them for about a month, now.We decided to get the extra tall based on user reviews of the regular height that said the children began to climb the gates as they got older.  We have these blocking our stairs so our 15 month old daughter can't fall down them.She has figured out that the latch needs to slide in order to open the gate, but can't open it due to the safety feature of having to lift the gate slightly to open it. Make sure you position it correctly or the swing closed feature will not work properly, but when you have it correctly aligned and tightened this is a great feature for the gate and has been really helpful!We got this set with the extensions because the width of our stairwell measures 35.5" so we thought the gate with the 3.5" extension would be a perfect fit.  However, when we received the gate and set it up as such it seemed less sturdy than we had hoped because the buffer pads we extended near their full length. So we switched to the 7" extensions which was a closer fit to the opening but make for a much tighter/safer fit all around!
+1	We use this on the bottom of our back stairs.  The height is perfect so when an adult walks down they don't feel like they would flip over it.  Easy to open and love that auto close!!  Great quality and sturdy too.  My little guy has tugged and pulled on it and it has not moved!  Love it!
+1	I ordered this gate to fit a 42" doorway and the product description states that it will fit a 42.5" doorway. When I received that gate in the mail and took out the instruction manual, it provided diagrams detailing how to use extensions to make the gate 39" and how to make the gate 49" (with extensions that are larger and not provided). I was ready to return the product but decided to take it out of the box and measure it and found that it actually does extend to 42.5" but that the manual just doesn't show this configuration of extensions. We have had to return several baby gates because they wouldn't work with our baseboards, but this worked like a charm. It's nice that you can either screw these into the wall or use the sticky tabs provided- I chose to use screws and the gate doesn't budge. It feels very strong and secure- not cheap at all. I'm happy with the purchase so far- will update it if we have any issues!
+1	Very solid well made gate. Doesn't have a foot opening option but that hasn't been an issue, opens easily enough even if your hands are full, but the little one cannot open it. Mounts easily (definitely want to screw the mounting pads into the wall though if a permanent placement, friction based installation will not stand up to little one yanking on it). Gate closes automatically behind you... if we want to prop open we just set a chair next to it to prop.
+1	I have a very tricky 18month old who likes to stack things outside gates to make an escape - this gate has thwarted his attempts! It's a GREAT height where he can't try to open it. Total peace of mind! Really solid construction and super easy to install (although I didn't use the wall discs - those are a pain). Highly recommend!!
+1	This is one of the best investments that we have made!  We have two that keep half the house "off limits."  It's aesthetically pleasing, durable, reliable and easy to operate.  It's also tall enough to discourage our two golden retrievers from jumping up on it or trying to get through.  My husband and I are fairly tall and it's nice not having to bend down at all to open them.  Our son (now 16 months) hangs onto them and shakes them with all his body, like a prisoner trying to escape and it's hopeless- he will not get through no matter how much he may try.The only reason to not give this gate 5 stars is that the installation process, however easy it may be, is very sensitive.  You have to make sure that the bottom of the gate is exactly level, otherwise the swing-closed mechanism may not work smoothly.  We had to re-install one cup that holds the pressure mount in order for the gate to swing closed on its own like it's designed.  Also- the installation requires you to drill screws into the door frame (or wall or wherever you install it) and this will leave holes once we eventually take the gates out.  We don't mind because we know they'll be there for at least a few years until we're done having children.
-1	i bought this product expecting that it would have an option to keep the gate open when you go in and out of a room quickly, instead it swings shut immediately and you have to use both hands to open the gate again. for that reason i wouldn't buy this product again.
+1	This is everything it is stated to be.  It is tall but comes in handy as the children grow up and are able to reach higher. The biggest plus is the metal construction.  Have accidentally run into these baby gates in the middle of the night and the all metal construction has saved it more than once.  The wood frame style if torqued will split and break at the bottom.  This is a stylish gate and the few plastic parts blend in well.  Easily fits in our 36&#34; door opening with an extension to spare.  The screw out door anchors have rubber style pads that prevent slipping and damage to the door frame (even if it is knocked down).  Easy to setup and sets firmly in place.  Only a &#34;mindless&#34; adult will be able to knock it over.
+1	I ordered one of these gates for the bottom of my stairway hall. It is a seriously sturdy gate - and when they say extra-tall... it is REALLY tall. Taller than I thought. I immediately ordered another gate. Pretty easy to install - you do need strong hands. It would be nice if they gave you drywall screws since the cups you're supposed to mount to the wall easily move if you don't use a drywall screw. However, the gate is absolutely fabulous. I couldn't be happier with the quality and price.
+1	Overall, this is a good product. It's strong, not flimsy at all. However, the gate is very narrow so, if you use it, put it somewhere where you do not have to carry anything through it like a car seat or stroller. The gate combined with the height make that extremely difficult. Also, make sure the walls you will put it against are exactly even. We bought it for the downstairs, but will move it upstairs.
+1	It's strong and sturdy, but the gate itself can be kind of narrow when you are carrying things. It would have been nice had they considered this.
+1	I love this diaper bag. After trying alot of different styles and sizes, we finally got one that works. This bag is great. The front pockets make it easy to organize and get to things quickly. Love the built in stroller clips, they just need to be a bit bigger. The only compliant about this bag, is I wish it could be a bit bigger inside. Other than that, it is a wonderful bag.
+1	This is a cute diaper bag for dad that will not make him feel like he is carrying a diaper bag!
+1	I've had this bag for almost 4 years.  I'm a girl, not a dude, but that's okay.I guess this bag is not huge--I've never had another one to compare to--but I have enough room to fit my wallet, camera, phone, keys (interior pocket), more keys (clipped on one of the clips), a bottle (in the special bottle pocket), a wet bag, diapers, wipes container, drinking glasses, plates, a spare pair of toddler pants, and a couple snack cups, with some room left over to shove in a toddler jacket or two if needed.  Not bad.I think I had to put it through the washing machine once due to spilled milk, or maybe I just hand washed it.  Either way, it cleaned up fine.  In fact, it looks about the same as when I got it.  I haven't used it every day, but I have used it a good number of days and it has held up.
+1	So far we really like this bag.  The only thing I don't care for is that the bag is really loud.  There is some sort of material under the lining that makes the bag sound like you are crumpling papers every time you move.
+1	I ordered this bag as a gift for a coworker and her husband.  This particular product was on their baby registry through Amazon.  I received it and was so happy at how much it looked like the picture and the description of the product was spot on.  My coworker and her husband were both very excited about it.  Thank you!
+1	This bag is so roomy, and the compartments help keep multiple things organized and handy! The navy blue nylon fabric wipes clean and looks good with the orange trim. Strap was comfortable for my husband.
+1	Things seem a tight fit this bag.  Also we wish it had a slightly different layout.  However we are happy with the comfort and the fact that it doesn't slip off your shoulder when carrying it.  Its good for a quick jaunt out but if you are everything and the kitchen sink people you'll need a different bag.
+1	This is a really cute diaper bag. My husband loves it and there's plenty of compartments for storage. My only complaint is that it's a little small for the price.
-1	This diaper bag is cute. That's all there is to say for it! I got it for my first baby and could only use it if I had a second bag to put all the baby stuff in that wouldn't fit in the diaper dude.  the front zip pockets are tiny, as are all the compartments. I spent 60 bucks on this and now I use a reusable grocery bag that cost $2 because it's so much better! If I had that $60 back I'd go buy a nice normal Graco diaper bag like all my friends have. Grrr.
+1	We've had this bag for two years.  I love it.  The pockets in the front are big enough to hold diapers and/or a soft sided wipe container.  We have meds and creams in one front pocket, diapers in the other, and snacks in another.  Inside we have wipes, a towel, a bib, a change of clothes, and the changing pad that came with it, and a toy.  If it were any bigger, we'd lose stuff in there. The back pocket is super easy to stuff things in while on the go.  The strap is long enough to just hang the bag on our Bob stroller.  it's comfortable and still looks brand new despite being dragged around a lot.  I'm so happy we got it!
+1	My niece is married to a cop - a big burley guy who really didn't want to be seen lugging around a girlie diaper bag. I do daycare for them a few afternoons a week and dad drops off. He has no problem being seen with this diaper bag.The perks of this product other than the looks:- It's easy to operate eyes free. No need to look. The three outer pockets are distinct. You can put a nook in one, diapers in the middle, and bottle in the third. Just feel, unzip and grab.- The zippers tabs and pulls are large. Perfect again for eyes free and one-handed use. Parents are pros at both of these maneuvers.- The zippers are also coated with heavy paint. This will help avoid them becoming freezing cold or burning hot. Again - someone was thinking when designing this bag.- It stands upright on it's own nicely which aids in one handed use.The downsides are:- As others have mentioned, the size. The outer pockets could have been a little bigger and maybe the entire thing could be wider.- An inner divider would be a nice touch- Also an insulated pocket to hold a chilled bottle would make this product perfect.I still give it five stars. It's meant to be a cool enough bag for dads and if my police officer nephew will tote it around, it has accomplished its mission.
+1	This is the second diaper dude bag I have purchased. The first bag, in red, I bought for my husband a couple of years ago when we had our first child. Unfortunately for him, I liked it so much that I have appropriated it, necessitating in the purchase of a second bag for his use. I prefer to use this bag over my Kate Spade Stevie bag, which although stylish is not as efficient. This bag is hard wearing, has excellent use of space and you can get things out of it while wearing it. I even use it as my go to flight bag. And my husband is extremely happy to have his own bag again.
+1	This diaper bag is awesome. There's enough space to stash everything you need and has hooks that can attach to you pram or stroller. This bag also looks masculine on a male and inconspicuous when hooked to the pram.
+1	I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over.  It was especially great while traveling.  At some point functionality takes over style.  This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else.  It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly.  Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should.
+1	I bought a giant diaper bag to use, (Skip Hop Duo) then found it to be too big and cumbersome to use on a daily basis, so I switched to using my husband's grey Diaper Dude diaper bag and found it to be much more manageable.  I carry a LOT of stuff in it, so it's always jam packed full and I wish it was just a little bit bigger.  The hubby doesn't mind carrying it since it is in boyish colors and because he can wear it like a messenger bag.  I usually end up carrying it over my shoulder like a purse so the strap is a little too long.  Overall, I like it, hubby likes it, and it holds everything you need for a day outing.
+1	Just got this bag via Amazon, first I LOVE that it's a messenger type and not flowery or pink.  Maybe I'll change my tune as my baby gets older, but I've seen friends/family lugging around a whole house-full of gear/toys/clothes/blankets/food for their kid in massive diaper bags, most of which they never seem to use - I have no intention of doing any of that.  This seems to hold what I think I'll actually need, a few diapers, wipes, a bottle or two, change of clothes, a toy, my wallet/keys.  Only annoyance so far is the cell holder, considering how many people have smartphone/iphones now I can't understand why they would include a holder for a flip phone.  I also don't love the changing pad, it doesn't fold as nicely as I think I'd like, I want to pick up one of the wallet-style changing pads that are more compact and fold nicer.  All in all I see this as a perfect urban bag.
+1	This bag is great for me to carry things I need for my son it comes in so many difrent designs and has lots of room to be perpared
+1	My husband and I LOVE this bag -- we requested another one too, so we both have one.  Pockets everywhere so you don't look/feel like a mountaineer when packing all of baby's stuff and yours.  Love the fact that you can attach it to the back of the stroller too (so you don't need another organizer!  Genius!) Cell phone pocket is good too, and it comes with a diaper changing pad inside.  Roomy, holds a ton of stuff....and manly enough for him so he doesn't feel like he's "left out" (not that he'd mind carrying a flowery one, but still, Dad's gotta have some fun too, right?)
+1	My husband and I love this bag. It's super comfortable, easy to use and has lots of compartments for organization. Overall a great everyday bag!
+1	When I was pregnant, I wanted a bag that my husband would use as well. We found this one and thought it was perfect. Now almost a year later, I can say for sure, this bag is great. It has three outside pockets that work for holding wipes or little baggies of food or a camera or whatever. The inside is plenty big with a pouch to store the diapers in. The fold out changing pad is perfect and wipes down easily. I cannot recommend this bag enough!
+1	I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.  I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.  I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.  It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.  Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.  If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.
+1	I really like this diaper bag. I bought it primarily because my husband is a stay at home dad and he is the one who will be using it the most. My only gripe is that it's not as wide inside as I thought it would be. But it has all of the outside pockets, so it will work just fine.
+1	This is a bag I don't mind carrying and DH definitely appreciates the manly, ergonomical, carry-all for baby's needs. There are 3 pockets on the outside perfect for bottles and food. On the other side is a large pocket deep enough to fit a table PC or iPad, and even a sleeve for your cell phone. The sleeve for the phone is a little on the smaller size and doesn't fit most smart phones, but it's also a great place to stash a binkie!
+1	enough compartments for little thing, very stylish and practical, has cell phone pocket and key hook,come with diaper change pad too. too bad it got stolen...because my husband forgot lock the car. I guess somebody thinks there's money in it, but not.
+1	My husband and I use this diaper bag every day and love it.  It's a good size, has good storage and is good quality.
+1	Both my husband and I like this bag a lot.  There's enough space to pack everything you need (for us, first-time, one-child parents, that's two-three extra onesies in case of a blow-out or leak, a pair of socks, a hat, hand sanitizer, diaper clutch with diapers and wipes, burp cloth(s), wet bag for dirty cloth diapers, nursing cover, receiving blanket, bib, and the stuff that used to live in my purse and now is part of the diaper bag).  There's also room to shove a few things like a sling or book or something in the back slim pocket, plus leftover room for a few extra items for longer trips out.  The pockets are nice for organization, with a nice roomy main compartment.  We like the cross-shoulder design, we feel that is best because a one-shoulder diaper bag often will slip off as you maneuver stroller/car seat, etc.  However, just a note that you can't really wear it cross-body when you have your child in a front-carrier, but it does fine sitting on one shoulder for a bit - hasn't posed too much of a problem yet.  We are really glad we invested in this diaper bag, and my husband likes that it's not too &#34;girly&#34; in pattern and that it doesn't look like a hobo-bag type purse like some diaper bags.
-1	I wanted to purchase a diaper bag that didn't look like one.  But I do wish I had searched around more.  The Diaper Dude is bulky.  It's hard to find what you are looking for in the larger storage area and it's always in the way.  A backpack-style bag would have been a better option.
+1	If you happen to live in a tiny studio without a full kitchen this is a great thing to have.  Sterilizes your bottles in minutes and keeps it sterilized up to 24 hours.
+1	I LOVE this product. I use it all day and all night to sterilize my bottles, nipples and breast pump accessories. I have never had one issue with it and I could not live without it. I'm a hard person to please but this product is amazing. Boiling everything took too much time and I hate the way the dishwasher makes everything smell. This little machine answered my sterilizing prayers.
+1	I LOVE Avent products. I only used Avent bottles with both my kids and I own both the Avent iQ24 Steam ELECTRIC sterilizer, as well as the Avent Steam MICROWAVE sterilizer. I like both of them ... and RECOMMEND them over boiling water in a pan any day. However (if price were not an issue), I do like the iQ24 a little better, simply because you can just plug it in, add water, and don't have to worry about taking something in and out of the microwave. It is very easy to use and the digital display tells you the status, so no guessing. You do pay for that added "convenience" and the bells and whistles of the digital display and alerts.As for boiling water ... when you first bring your baby home from the hospital (whether it be your first, second, etc.), you are generally sleep-deprived and not exactly thinking at your best or clearest. The LAST thing you want to be doing in this state of mind is BOILING water on the STOVE TOP to sterilize bottles. You cannot/should not walk away from the boiling water to do other things (which is hard to do as a parent of a newborn). In a sleep-deprived state, if you walk away, you WILL at one time forget you had the bottles boiling. There is no safety mechanism ... the water will eventually evaporate ... and that is dangerous. This is why I like the Avent STEAM sterilizers ... they do the job without supervision, so you can do your job as a parent.The GREAT thing about the iQ24, is you plug it in and put the bottles in to be sterilized. You can remove them in 6 minutes, or leave them there (where they will remain sterilized). You don't have to stay with the iQ24 to "supervise" it, as you do with boiling water. You can pick up a crying baby, change a dirty diaper, or just sit down and get some much needed rest. To me, that was the "priceless" part of the iQ24 ... that ONE less thing to worry about.The Avent MICROWAVE steam sterilizer does essentially the same thing, but with less bells and whistles and less expense.It also works great to sterilize pacifiers.I give it 5 STARS ... just wish it weren't so expensive. :)
+1	The first one I bought was not working properly.  It always complained I've added too much water.  I replaced it and the second one worked fine.Compared with microwave sterilizers or electric sterilizer from other brands, this sterilizer is rather pricey, but I'm glad I've picked this one.  I set the sterilizer to 24 hours mode so the bottles are ready to use all the time (you still need to replace water inside every day).  When I was holding my hungry and crying baby in one arm, I was really glad that the bottle is already sterilized and ready to use right away.
-1	I bought this toy for my 10 month old niece as a gift, but decided to buy one for my 23 month old son so that he could have a nice soft ball to throw around the house (he's got a good arm). The ball is nice and soft (even though the little jingler inside can be felt if the ball is thrown hard enough), it's great for learning to catch, and my son likes to fling it around by the tags. However, my son decided to carry the ball around in his mouth like the doggies do, and one of the tags actually cut his little tongue! Even made him bleed! I am PISSED that something being advertised as soft and comforting could do this. I touched the tags afterwards and they are actually quite "sharp" in the creased area... had to warn my sister about letting my niece put this in her mouth. Boo on you, Taggies.
+1	I got this for a friend's child and he loves it!  It saves the random tags around their house from getting destroyed too!  The ball itself has soothing pastel colors and is very soft.  Great for rolling or tossing.
+1	My baby took a little time to like this ball -- he doesn't pay that much attention to the tags, but now he likes the big soft ball to wrestle with ocassionally and he likes the jingley-rattley sounds. He is not interested in rolling it. He has a favorite tag, but doesn't focus too much on the tags. He enjoys it mostly when I hold a tag and dangle the ball around by his face making it make noise and sort of make it bounce-bounce-bounce (like dribbling the ball while holding the tag) ... he also likes when I through it way up in the air and catch it ... maybe he will eventually like playing with it himself when he's older (he's 10.5 months old). But I do like that it is a cushiony soft ball, so he doesn't get hurt. And I think the times when he does play with the tags it is good for his motor skills and exploration of the differences in the tags.
+1	I gave this 4 stars only because I haves used this on my 6 month old several times, an it does keep all of the food off his chest and arms, but it does always seem to let a little bit of food drip onto the collar of his outfits. I just can never seem to get the ties tight enough. When he gets a bit older, this bib will probably work great, but I think it fits best for 12 months and up. It is a plus that is ties in the back and does not velcro, because my son has recently learned how to pull velcro bibs off.
+1	Yes, this material is a little 'plastic-y' and stiff, but I have found that bibs that are too soft or cloth-like aren't as good as repelling water or food.  This has been a great find for us.  I really appreciate the elastic around the wrist-bands -- not too tight and just perfect for my son.  I should state that he is a big 9 month old, but not off the charts.  I was pleased to get the Dr. Seuss one at a reduced price.  I love a better deal!
-1	I ordered this in my daughter's size months ago and she still hasn't grown into it.  I'm sure it will be great when it finally fits but the sizing is way off.
+1	This is our new favorite bib (and I want to buy more)! This bib provides full coverage. It ties in the back, covering baby's neckline (no need to remove baby's shirt) and covers baby's arms (no need to roll up sleeves). The print is really cute and it seems to wash well. The only thing I would change about this bib is the front pocket, which is (for some unknown reason) divided right down the middle, making food removal more difficult.
+1	Not a big hit with my 12 month old. He doesn't like the noise or feel on his arms. He likes the regular bibs by this company
+1	This covers most of my baby and is easy to rinse off in the sink. I like that it ties rather than has velcro--velcro tends to irritate my baby's neck. The fabric is light and not too stiff, but still repels liquids. The elastic is a bit too tight at the wrists, however (though this does prevent food from sliding down his arms).
+1	this is a  great bib for messy meals! the elastic cuffs keep most everything out of the sleeves. it is great!
+1	Fits well, relatively easy to get on. Washes up nicely too. My little guy looks very cute in it and works perfectly for messy meals!
+1	I purchased one of each, and I prefer the Bumkins. The major difference for me is that the Bumkins has elastic at the wrists, which prevents the sleeves of whatever baby is wearing underneath from getting dirty, especially if the bib is a little on the large side. The Kushies bib doesn't have the elastic, so the cuffs of his sleeves poke through and get dirty unless I roll them up underneath. Also, the Bumkins bib ties at the neck, while the Kushies bib has velcro. My little guy can pull the velcro bib right off, but the Bumkins one stays securely tied. One other note: If you choose a design that has white or light-colored trim, the trim will stain. Not that big a deal, but if this sort of thing bugs you, I would choose a pattern with darker trim.
+1	I bought this for my son, he is 12 months old and he is always messing up his cloths when he eats :) This really helps cut down on the mess! I love that its waterproof and has long sleeves. Also it is big enough to grow with him! The only thing that I wish were different is the tie in the back, they should have made them snaps instead.
+1	Great sleeved bib. Machine washable! I love that the hand holes are elastic so no food gets into their arms. The tie closure is also great to keep the bib on because our son likes to rip bibs off and he can't with this bib.
+1	I like this bib better than the Baby Bjorn one because it's not rigid and has sleeves.  At first I didn't like that you had to tie it in the back and wish it had velcro straps, but it does make it harder for baby to take off.  Easy to wash and dries quickly.
+1	Sorry for shouting.  I am in love with this bib.  So in love with it that I immediately had to get online and review it.  My daughter is the messiest, drags her arms through the food, smears it into the tray, rubs it in her hair, on the walls.  Goodness!  She has a fit when she I put a bib on her.  She just doesn't like bibs for some reason.  Usually it will end in her shoving the bib in her mouth so that she can't eat the food or she is crying for me to take it off.  I usually give in and then I have to work on her clothes to get stains out.  It had gotten so bad that I have been feeding her in nothing but her diaper and wiping her down from head to toe after.  No more!  I got this bib today and I gave it the ultimate test, lasagna.  She usually has food on her lap, but not a drop.  The bib was long enough to keep her lap covered and the pockets caught what she dropped.  I only needed to wipe her hands and face.  Nothing on her clothes thanks to this bib.  And she thought it was a shirt, so she didn't pull on it or stick it in her mouth, no tears.  It washed up easily.  I am very happy with this product and will probably order another.  Also look at the Sugar Booger Splat Mat on Amazon.  It has been a lifesaver too for my messy girl.
+1	I purchased to use when we started solids with my son.  At 6 months this is still quite big for him.  Can't wait to use it when he gets a little bigger.  Love that it has long sleeves to protect his clothes.
+1	I love Bumpkins bibs!  Washable, lightweight, quick-drying, great for home, restaurants, travel.  Never had one stain, used them with beets, tomatoes, paint, food color, Easter egg dye, you name it (although after a few years, the white trim is just a little off-white now, but that is to be expected!).  I use this model for an art smock, but would absolutely bring it along for Christmas dinner or any other dress up occasion with a messy meal!  I have three different Bumpkins styles, this one, the one like this with short sleeves, and the regular bibs.  I absolutely love them, best parenting investment ever!
-1	These bibs used to be the greatest, thin silky completely waterproof and fast-drying material.  But the company moved production from the US to China and it is just not the same now.  I wanted an extra for the diaper bag but the one made in China is much thicker and quite stiff.  I thought it might soften up with time, but it hasn't after a few months of daily washings.  It is waterproof, but the stiffness causes it to get in the baby's way and because it doesn't flow over baby's lap, more food ends up on the clothes.  It also is much harder to wash due to the stiffness, and takes a long time to dry because of the thickness.  But if you can find one of the old ones made in the USA, those are great!  I had one Superbib for a couple years and then when this sleeved one was so disappointing, I went to a baby store nearby and looked through their rack and they had one sleeved one left that had been made in the US of the better material, and that one is fabulous.  The old style is so soft and supple, super-comfy for baby, and a breeze to wash (I just dunk it in dishwater and rinse) and dries amazingly fast.
+1	This bib is fantastic. The only down size is the neck is large, the rest is pretty good! I will be ordering a few more  now that my kiddo has started to feed himself more.
+1	I couldn't believe how much time I had to spend each day trying to get stains out of clothes. And with winter coming up, I wanted to get long sleeve bibs, which for some reason I haven't seen in Babies R Us or any other store. Every bib I got seemed to have some issue, but I thought it might be helpful for others to see a comparison of the details:SIZEKushies - the smallest of the three bibs (sleeve - 11 inches from neck, width - 10 inches, length - 13 inches from neck).Ikea - sleeve (14 inches from neck, including a 1 inch fabric cuff), width (12 inches from one seam to another but another 8 inches that wrap around - yea!!), length (14 inches from neck)Bumpkins - sleeve (14.5 inches from neck), width (13.5 inches), length (12.5 from neck)Tidy Turtle - the largest (sleeve - 16 inches from neck, width - 14 inches, legth - 15 inches from neck)MATERIALKushies and Ikea are very thin, like umbrella material. Kusies folds down to nothing - great for a full diaper bag. Ikea folds a little thicker due to cloth cuffs and extra fabric. Tidy Turtle and Bumpkins are thicker and stiffer. Tidy Turtle has a visibly larger weave.CUFFSAll the sleeves have a 3-inch opening (in diameter).Kushies - no elastic cuff. Food may fall in and drip onto the baby's arms/clothes.Ikea - 1 inch of soft spandex fabric. The cuff opening is just a little bit smaller than the other bibs.Bumpkins and Tidy Turtle - elastic sewn inside the bib material.NECK CLOSUREMy 20lb baby has a skinny neck. Unfortunately, all of the bibs are about the same size around the neck, regardless of what type of closure. Bumpkins ties together at the neck, and the others have velcro. Even they are supposed to be "adjustable" velcro, they are all about the same size opening on the smallest setting. With velcro, you also have to make sure you stick it together before washing. Otherwise, it will stick to and ruin your other clothes.In general, all the long sleeve bibs seem too big for my my 1 year old and were too big around the neck area. Sometimes I use a clothes pin to make the neck opening smaller. Aside from that, I feel that Bumpkins and Ikea provide the best coverage without being too big. They are wide and long enough on the bottom and have an elastic cuff to keep Baby's clothes clean. I like Ikea's thinner material and spandex cuffs, but Bumpkins looks cuter (we love Cat in the Hat).
-1	We couldn't get the sleeves past our child's hands. She's really not that big. The elastic around the cuffs is super tight. We gave it away. We like the other regular bibs from this company. Cute designs.
+1	Everyone should have at least one sleeved bib for messy meals. This one worked great and seemed well made. Fit nice and I liked the tie back
+1	we love this bib and are on our second one we loved the first so much :)  easy clean up, not too bulky
+1	Baby led weaning is so messy, but this helps! He still gets food a little around the collar and on pants, so take off pants. Soft and easy to wear, pleasing designs!
+1	My 13-month-old daughter loves to rip bibs secured with velcro right off.  These, will certainly stay on and they are easy to wash.  However, it's not super easy to fit wiggling arms through the arms (which are a bit long on my daughter who is in the 50th percentile for height and 10th for weight).  Overall, we like these when we really want to make sure her outfit will stay neat and clean.  Otherwise, it's not really worth the effort.
+1	When my grandson eats with his long sleeve shirts on it can be a challenge to keep them clean.  I usually take the shirt off but now with this bib I don't have too.  It is soft and easy to clean.  I have even washed it in the washing machine.  The pocket catches what he drops.  Love the quality and it will last a few years.
+1	This smock is AWESOME!!!  My daughter is transitioning to &#34;big people&#34; food and this keeps her clothes clean and keeps me from having to give her a bath after every. single. meal.  I only ordered one, but I will be ordering more now that I have tried them and been so impressed.  She likes the design too!  The elastic wrists keeps the food from traveling up her arms and the pouch at the bottom keeps it from traveling down her legs.  Definitely a must buy.  I will be purchasing one of these for every baby shower I go to now.  Highly, highly recommend!!!
+1	This is great, does the job as you'd expect. It's a little hard to get over her hands, but overall pretty good.
+1	Needed something that tied in the back instead of velcro closures as my daughter always pulls those off. Love the long sleeves as well. Truly keeps her clothes mess free during meals.
+1	I have two of these bibs, I love them! I also have kushies bib and that one got moldy after several months. I had this bib for over a year. It still looks great. Unlike the kushies bib, this one does not hold the food stains and washes well. I used it since my son started solids. Now he is two and it still fits great and does the job. It keeps his clothes clean, so I don't have to change them after each eating.
+1	I love the bumkins bibs, they are easy to wash, catch most of the dropped food in the pocket, and are cute.  This bib is great for keeping our son's shirt and sleeves clean, but it is always a fight to get it on him.  Our little guys just doesn't have the patience to put his arms through it, he just wants his food.  As a consequence, we don't use it very often.
+1	Love this bib as I was sick of baby getting her sleeves so dirty.  The pocket is great as it catches the food she drops.  And it's so easy to clean in the sink right after she eats since it's waterproof.  What I don't like is the tie back.  I also bought a sleeved bib by SillyBillyz that has snaps on the back and the neckline is also fabric and stretchy.  Now, if it was only waterproof SillyBillyz would be perfect.  But I still prefer it over Bumkins.
+1	Excellent product. Our 8 month grandson wants only to feed himself and we know how messy that can be. With too many changes of clothes from this new stage in his life we had to find a bib that really covered him. This bib is prefect and well made for the price. We were not sure we would like the tie at the neck, but this has proved to be best instead of a velcro bib. He can pull a velcro bib off in a second.We are very pleased this purchase.
+1	My 11 month old is a very messy eater since she started feeding herself.  After trying a variety of bibs and still getting stains on my daughter's clothes, I tried this bib.  I love it!  It has saved me from my laundry nightmare.  It covers high up on the neck so food doesn't go down that way, it covers the length of the arm so I don't have to constantly be pushing her sleeves up, and it covers enough on her sides that even if she drops food next to her the bib is still protecting her clothes.  I will never use another bib.
+1	I thought the regular Bumkins bibs were great, and then I got these! With cold weather came long sleeves and I was tired of pulling my 17 month old daughter's sleeves up, which only sort of worked anyway - she is a messy eater and getting into a defiant stage. These have been wonderful! No liquid soaks through, and the sleeves fit well so they drag in the food and are not cumbersome. The fabric is lightweight and breathable. We even used them with her formal Thanksgiving dress and, as usual, not a single drop or stain on her outfit. Now if they just made something for the hair and face! Hahaha! Seriously, best bib ever.
+1	This bib is awesome.  I bought it for an average sized 14 month old.  It goes on her easily and keeps her clothes clean and dry.  We use it for painting, playdough, water play and messy meals.  The cuffs are elastic so it keeps her clothes clean and dry.  I really like that I can tie it at the neck so she can't pull it off.  It's a heavy material so it doesn't move as easily as others, but that keeps her dry too.  I would definitely recommend this bib.
-1	I have purchased several Bumkin waterproof bibs, one of them is the long sleeve one in yellow color. i must admit i purchased yellow robot one because it was cheaper than other colors, but when it arrived i realized that the quality is not the same as the sleeveless blue colored bibs i purchased earlier. material is rough, it feels cheap and almost scratchy. i regret not spending few more $ and purchasing a different color which i am assuming would have been a better quality product as well
+1	Pretty good bib.  It works well at keeping my sons sleeves clean, but I did find a different long- sleeved bib I like better.  I prefer the version that has Velcro rather than tie strings and the elastic around the ends of the sleeves on this bib make it a little bit more difficult to get on a less than cooperative baby.
+1	I am a mother of 6 and I have tried nearly every bib on the market over the past 11 years.  This is my favorite! It completely protects baby's clothes from even the messiest messes. I am going to buy 3 more and throw away all the others! I was worried that the tie-closure would be difficult, but it's not. Because of the tie, this is the only bib my babies can't rip off. Elastic on the cuffs makes it so I don't even have to push up their sleeves! Cute prints. To lengthen it's life, I'll only air dry, but I will probably still machine wash.
+1	My little guy loves to feed himself...and I was doing laundry after every meal. I bought two of these so I could always have one clean. I think the only thing that would work even better is to have little legs sleeves as well. Regular bibs just don't cut it.
+1	This bib is wonderful! We use it anytime we have spaghetti, ravioli, anything that will stain and is very saucy.
+1	I LOVE these. I bought the largest size for my chunky 10 month old. They cover him completely and are so easy to wipe clean or throw in the wash. Never a mess or stain on his clothes! When he sits in the high chair though, they are a little long so the pocket does nothing and don't catch food. I'm guessing it will as he grows taller and the bib isn't so long. Even after he doesn't need bibs anymore I plan on using these are like &#34;art&#34; smocks.
+1	In a desperate attempt to curb mealtime laundry stains ordered this bib and the infant sized Kushies too. This one is made of a heavier fabric than the Kushies. It has elastic cuffs which the Kushies does not. At first my daughter preferred the Kushies. I think because it is feather weight and has no elastic. However, after a few weeks of alternating these two bibs, she will gladly wear either. This Bumkins is decidedly bigger and therefore gapes a bit at the neck. I use another fabric bib underneath for messy pasta meals. Also, both bibs will stain slightly (similar to Tupperware) with pasta sauce. I gave this one five stars because it has the elastic cuffs, comes in a pretty girly fabric and has plenty of room to grow.
+1	I love long sleeved bibs.  The Bumkins ones hold up extremely well. We have some that are 4 years old and still look perfect.  I like that they tie behind the neck as our daughter pulls anything with velcro off.  These bibs have fantastic coverage and we always use them when we are out on the town as we know that we won't have to change clothes after the meal due to mess.
+1	we use it every meal and we are near successful in stain free clothing finally!!! Our lo eats aeverythign by herself so it can get messy!
+1	After purchasing multiple bibs from Walmart and Target, and ordering others online, without a doubt I recommend these bibs. I only wish I found these earlier. I purchased 2 for my twins, blue fizz color and they match the photo. My twins are 15m and these fit great, room to grow and also not so large they could of worn them when they were younger. The sleeves have elastic on the ends so they don't slide up or down. The pocket works well for my kids. The tie in the back as the closure is prefect because my twins know how to take bibs off but the tie is long enough to not be tight on their little necks. It works well as waterproof and after washing there has been no fading in color, rips or fading on waterproofing.
+1	The inventor of this bib is a genius. This is great for the winter! I don't have to take off my baby's clothes so they don't get destroyed while she eats. This very effectively saves her long sleeves from getting dirty, and as usually with these bibs the pocket does a great job of catching everything she drops. These bibs are so worth the money!One GREAT thing about this is that it ties in the back. My daughter is little and the tie allows me to pull it up right around her neck so nothing slips down underneath it. Her other bumkins bib, and her tommee tippee bibs do not have this.... and this is another reason why this bib is my all time favorite!
+1	Now that my daughter is eating finger foods I use this bib all the time. It's very good to avoid a big mess at meal times. The material is very good. It doesn't create mildew like other bids, it's very easy to wash and it dries really fast, so I can have it ready for the next meal. It's worth buying it! The reason whay I only gave 4 stars it's because I don't like the designs that much.
+1	This is by far the best waterproof bibs I have bought for my son (tried several different types/brands but this overall is the best one hands down).  No more stains on clothes!  Whenever I know he's going to eat something messy (ex: spaghetti, etc) this bib goes on him.  It is very cute and washes well. I throw it in the washer every so often to clean it really well (use the gentle cycle) and the bib still has not warped.  Highly recommend!!!Here are some of the brands of bibs I've tried already:~Circo Easy Wipe Bibs from Target (awful, by far the worst bibs...they warp/wrinkle very easily when washed; everyone of them got thrown away within a short time; waste of money).~Bumkins super bib (very great bib..same material as the sleeved bib and just as easy to clean.  We use these bibs anytime our child is not going to have as big of mess when eating or when traveling)~Baby Treasures Easy Wipe Bibs from Kohls (pretty good, the material of them is more similar to the Circo bibs from Target but for some reason these didn't warp yet.  They are pretty easy to clean.)
+1	My 8 month old is a messy eater!  He loves feeding himself mashed up bananas, so you can imagine!  This bib saves me from changing his whole outfit everytime he needs to eat.  And it's big enough, it should fit him for quite awhile.  Waiting for another color to go on sale so I can buy him a second one!
-1	Was sent in the wrong color. Was an orange background with green eggs and ham print on it, but not as cute as the green one pictured. It also stated lead safe vs. lead free. When I checked the bumkins website, the current bibs for sale say lead free which makes me think this is an older model and that it may not be to the most updated safety standards despite and another reviewer stating that the lead safe were the newer ones.
+1	This was the only bib that worked on my toddler. She ripped every other bib off in seconds; it was impossible to keep her clothes covered. This bib covers everything up nicely and the best part is that it ties in the back. Now she cannot just rip it off. Anything with velcro or the hard bibs that snapped or the snap button bibs were nothing for her. This one she just gave up on ripping off. I love it.
+1	We use this when I don't feel like taking my son's shirt off to feed him.  He tends to make a mess when he is feeding himself so this makes sure it stays off his clothes.  Love that this is super easy to clean.
+1	These are cute, durable, and I love that they tie instead of velcro.  However, I think they could be a bit longer.  They barely cover my toddler's lap, and sometimes he gets food on his pants if I'm not careful to watch him.
+1	I purchased this for my small 9 month old and it's huge.  It's made of really good quality materials and will last a long time.  But it's big and made for larger/older kids.  Which is fine, she'll grow into it, but don't think you're getting this for a beginner eater.  The sleeves are nice and will fit snug on her wrists and the tie in the back is long enough to tie in a bow.  It's going to be a really great thing once we grow into it!
+1	This smock-style bib works well for my 13-month-old. This bib is a fantastic wipe-able, washable water proof material that isn't too stiff or plastic-like. My only negative feedback is on the pocket; unlike our other Bumkins regular bibs, it's stitched up the middle to create two separate pockets, and doesn't gap very much... so it doesn't do a great job of catching the spills.
+1	I like these they are great, they do the job they are intended to do and protect my LO's clothes from all the messiness of solids!
+1	Nice bib.  Rinses clean and dries quickly.  Fits my baby well at 18 to 20 months.  Very good for particularly messy eaters.  Should fit her well for at least the next 6 months and possibly longer.  Pocket is only good for catching liquids that drip down...not really good for food particles because it doesn't stay in an open position.  Ties behind the neck so baby cannot remove easily like velco bibs.  Also, can get the neck fairly snug because of the ability to adjust the size of the neck opening with the tie closure.  I don't know that I would recommend this for babies less than a year...would probably be too big.
+1	Covers the arms and most of the body when the toddlers are learning to self feed and the food goes everywhere.  Helps to lessen the stains in the loads of laundry!
+1	LOVE this bib. I need to buy more. This seems to be the only bib that works on my busy guy. Otherwise his shirts get to try a little bit of his food. The only complaint I have is that he's so interested in the pattern/putting the bib in his mouth, it's difficult to feed him. I really like the robot pattern- a little skeptical from the pic online, but when it came, I was really happy!
+1	We love the bumpkins bibs and I was actually using an old one as an art smock. I was happy to find the same one in a larger size.
+1	I got this smock for my two year old who likes to play with water in the kitchen sink. I was sick of changing her clothes after sink time and so I bought this smock. It goes on easily over her clothes and has worked to protect her from getting wet. She is picky about clothes but she likes the pocket and she seems to like the bright colors. It has worked for us.
+1	I looked forever to find something that wasn't filled with chemical plastic and that smelled terrible.  This is perfect! Non-toxic, no bad smell, cleans up really easily and is very cute!
+1	I love the material and design of this smock- I use it as a toddler bib in winter so child's sleeves stay clean.  However sleeve cuffs are very tight.  This is a plus to keep stuff from running down arms while eating (or painting), but if your child is on the bigger side it may be uncomfortable or leave a mark.
+1	We've had this for our daughter since she was able to stand at her easel... she's now two and a half and it will fit for a long while I think.  It keeps her clean for painting and many other projects.  We also bring it to the local kids museum to wear at the water tables since theirs are usually larger and very wet already.  Her shoes still get wet, but her clothes are saved from splashes.
+1	I bought two of these about two months ago. At the time I thought they where a little thin and wondered how long they would last.ProFits both my 2yr old and 3yr oldwipes down easilyTies in backThe print is prettyConsmaterial feels like it could rip easily or stretch.One of the two I have is already coming apart at the seams.Still like for the price I got them at.
+1	My toddler son is just getting into crafts. While I want to encourage him to do it, I also want his clothe to remain somewhat paint -free if possible :- ) This products helps with accomplishing just that. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and does not seem to bother my toddler...
+1	We've tried a LOT of bibs - and Bumkin bibs are the best!  It is truly waterproof, yet it can be washed in the washer (yay!).  This one in particular is a favorite because the long sleeves and generous length are prefect for protecting long sleeve clothes (or nice dresses).  This also has a tie at the neck (instead of the velcro that the short sleeve version has) which ensures that it doesn't snag sweaters/dresses and if you tie a double know its a little more difficult for tots to take off mid-meal.  We have two for each child and love them!
+1	Good bib but a little too wide for my son, who is 12 months/9 kilo, so it bunches at the neck and creates a bit of a gap. For a larger toddler with a better fit, this would be a great bib. I'll keep it until then. The arm holes help protect shoulders and keep the bib on kids who pull them off. I don't like how the pocket is stitched together in the middle because it can't be turned inside-out to clean. I bought some of the regular super bibs to use until he grows into this one.
+1	Bumpkins junior bib is the best feeding bib for your baby and toddler.  My daughter is 3 and a half and she still uses the same one I bought her when she was a baby for messy food.  I love that it is well made and so easy to clean.  If it needs more cleaning than just a quick wipe, I usually wash it with my hand soap in the kitchen sink and then hang it to dry so it's ready for the next feeding.  Sometimes I put it in the washer.  I recommend the junior bib over the regular because it goes over their arms so a baby cannot take it off and it covers much more.  It will catch food that is dropped whereas the non-junior one will not. I am buying more bibs now since I have a baby boy who is feeding himself on occasion and has to wear his sister's pink bib for messy food since his non-junior style bib will not catch the mess.
+1	This is the 3rd set of bibs I've bought and by far the best.  They're huge, easy to clean and dry, and best of all, they're comfortable so my son isn't always trying to take it off.  Plus, even if he were to try, because he has to put his arms through the sleeve holes, the bib can't be taken off easily like most other bibs.  With any other bib, he gets agitated (because the plastic can be hard around the neck) and just pulls hard and the velcro gives way and it comes off.  With this one, he seems to forget that it's on.  And of course, since it's so big, it really does a good job of protecting his clothes.The only issue I have, and it's a minor one, is that the pocket really doesn't catch any food.GET TWO cuz you'll inevitably lose one when going out
+1	This bib is absolutely adorable and covers my daughter's entire top half, which is nice when you want to protect clothing from messy, cloth staining foods!I like the velcro closing in the back and the pocket in the front really does end up catching dropped food. Great buy!
+1	These bibs not only protect clothes and wash up great, they come in fun patterns that my kids LOVE.  The robots are just as bright and colorful as the picture shows.  I'd purchase again!
+1	These rock. The designs are cute and they fit my 18 month old well, and will fit for awhile. I love them, easy to clean, quick to dry. I wish I started using these months ago!
+1	We purchased these bibs for our son when he was 21 months old.  He is now 28 months old and still uses them.  We love them.  They are bigger then the Bumkins infant bibs.  We slide our sons arms through the arms holes and close the velcro behind his neck.  It is long and covers his torso and part of his lap.  It cleans easily- we hand wash after each meal and it is dry by the time the next meal is ready.  We also machine wash them once a week.  (We hang to dry)  Great product but a little pricey.
+1	These are hands down "the" best bibs I have used! They cover everything that needs to be protected and baby can't yank it off. They wipe up easily,resist stains and are waterproof. The patterns are bright, bold and fun. I love the fact that they actually fit my daughter, without having to use clothes pins to keep it on her. I used to use Parent's Choice waterproof bibs. They were way too big around the neck and didn't cover very well. They were ok, but nothing compared to these bibs. I will now only buy these. Highly recommended!
+1	The bib works great.  My 14-month old is not able to pull it off, which was our only problem with the other Bumkins.  The only problem with this is that it is very big -- so the pocket doesn't sit in the right place and catch the falling food.  But other than that, it does the job.  She'll grow into it.  As with all Bumkins, it's easy to clean off.  I wipe it off or rinse it off in the sink, then hang to dry.  I wash/dry them with the rest of her laundry every weekend, and it's held up fine.
+1	I would have given it 5 stars but it has some stitching in the middle of the pocket, (I guess to hold it up), and it doesn't seem to catch as much food as our other bibs.  I love the waterproof feature but it does take a little longer to dry than our nonwaterproof ones.  I guess you have to choose the features you need for each meal.  I like the sleeves because it makes it harder for our 15 month old to pull it off.  Overall I like it better than my other bibs.
+1	My toddler gets so messy that it was a revelation when I discovered bibs with sleeves.  This bib is awesome.  You just wipe it down to clean it, it has a big pocket, and best of all- those sleeves really keep his whole shirt clean.
+1	My two year old loves this. We got them in the fish color, the pink paisley color, and the cream with flowers. She loves the first two the most. It is easy for her to put on, and she tucks it down while sitting in her chair so that the pocket stays under the tray.The pocket is deep enough for storage of necessities but mostly goes ignored by her. The bib is made of some sort of waterproof fabric, which is extremely easy to clean off - just wipe it down, no matter how dirty it gets. It's long enough to sit in her lap.There is a velcro adherent on the back which we have to help her with, but it is long enough for thick necks, or even thin ones. There are two armsleeves which are basically T-shirt style, coming down a small amount but we pull up her shirtsleeves so that she does not get them dirty. It can hang on the chair until ready, and is a cinch to put on her.It also has adjustable sleeves with elastic cuffs which are great to keep food out for those especially messy meals. The colors are vibrant and fun, and our two year old just loves it.
+1	I love bumkins bibs. They are flexible and keep my sons clothes clean. The pocket catches what he drops and it has a good fit. The designs are very cute and they wash up well. They aren't very bulky so they travel well too.
+1	We finally figured out to buy this Junior size bib for my son when he was 18 months old.  We had been using the smaller ones and we would have to change his pants after every meal.  I wish we had bought these sooner!  These are perfect for toddlers and are the only bibs we need now.
+1	I have 5 of these and everyone loves them.  They are waterproof which is a plus.  I do wish the pocket stuck out farther because often it doens't catch food that spill.
+1	I bought this for my toddler after many months of having his clothes come home from daycare all stained.  I know he's a very messy eater and I decided to try a bib with more coverage, so I bought this one.  It's wonderful - full coverage, lightweight and breathable, and easy to clean - no more stained clothes!!!
+1	Great coverage bib. It was hard to keep a regular bib on my toddler, and these did the trick. The sleeves were comfortable enough, that she didn't mind. The material was nice, and easy to clean. They survived multiple washes in the wash machine quite nicely too. We received a lot of compliments on the design of this bib when we were eating out.
+1	I received one of these bibs as a hand-me-down and really liked it. I bought this as a back-up. They work really well, have great coverage for a messy baby (mine is two now) whether they are eating or doing arts and crafts. They are easy to clean with a quick wipe down or rinse in the sink or in the laundry. I highly recommend!
+1	When I found the bumkin bib I fell in love!  Long lasting after MANY washes (I put them in a washing bag and they come out perfect in the washing machine) and the velcro is still like new.  Other bibs the velcro kinda gave out.  These are definitely worth the price because of how easy to wash, are waterproof and how long they last!
+1	Best bibs ever.  Love the pockets, love the washable material, love the sleeves.  Overall, it's great!  Plus it comes in really cute patterns.
+1	Love this bib!  Great for catching crumbs and puke (ich, I know, but this has saved me from cleaning high chair straps many, many times!).
+1	Great bib, the only one my darlings keep on. The cap sleeves are great, and these should fit for a long time because of the adjustable neck.
+1	I used to wash bibs constantly, now I just have this one bib that is perfect.  I always wash it off right away when my son is done with it and hang it on the high chair so that it dries for next time and is always clean and available.  The velcro tie in the back is nice and fast, and my son loves it because it is trucks.  Worth paying a little more for this print if you have a boy!
+1	Great item.  Covers clothing adequately.  Washes well in washing machine. Good buy. Only wish they had more patterns to choose from.
+1	Safe your money buying cheap bibs and buy this one. It saved us a lot of baby clothes from being ruined. Too bad we didn't have it from the beginning. It covers baby very well, cleans easy, almost doesn't get stained and a pocket catches all miss mouth food.
+1	Since my baby started solids at 6 mos, I've been using these Koala baby bibs that are pretty standard in size, plastic bonded over cotton, catch all pocket.  They were ok till my baby started attempting to feed himself.  They just don't have enough coverage and the plastic has long since separated from the cotton backing.  So then I bought those silicone Tommee Tippees and they were even worse.  They're small and they're bulky & don't drape, no matter how I tack it behind the high chair tray, 1/2 way thru the meal it inevitably ends up above the tray and food just fall right into his lap.Enter the Bumkins Jr bib to the rescue.  These are over the shoulders and way bigger than regular bibs.  Made of this awesome polyester material, I just hand wash after each feeding hang to dry and cause it is poly and not bonded plastic, I know they will last for a long while.  While it is still cold outside I'm rolling up his sleeves and clothes are still clean!  It'll be even better when the weather warms and he's wearing short sleeves!All in all a must have for self feeding babies!
+1	We own more than 10 of these bibs, and we love them. As far as I am concerned, they cannot be improved upon. Buy one and see. They are totally waterproof, roll up and stuff into diaper bags easily, and they come out of the wash looking like new. Even after 2 years of heavy use. Seriously, stop researching and buy this product (or any other Bumkins bib!)
+1	I highly recommend this product for a kid that hates wearing a bib..my son (11 months) couldn't take it off like all the other tens of bibs we tried and he actually treats it as of it's t-shirt or sth :D
+1	By far the best bib I have found to date! Excellent quality and the most adorable prints. I know others complained about the quality but if you wash and dry by hand per the instructions they will last forever!! They keep my children dry and food, drinks, markers, playdoh, etc... Off my child. They wipe off very easily. My child would get sick in the car and we would put the bib on before leaving the house and this would catch most of what came up. We are so thankful for these bibs and highly recommend them.
+1	Cute. Wasn't the material I was expecting it to be. It's more fabric ish than plastic, so I'm not too sure how waterproof it really is but it serves its purpose at preK I guess!
+1	These are a great fit, easy on, easy off, colors are not ridiculous and obnoxious, it is a great little bib.
+1	The pocket had a stitch sewed in the middle but i found its ok to open up the pocket after the stitch loosed up after around two weeks of use. It's easy to clean. No messy cloth any more. And my kiddo has no problem wearing it :)
+1	got when little. growing with our baby girl. covers a lot so less worry about clothes. but all clothes will get dirty. they're babies. it's gonna happen. velcro fastener purchased approx october 2013.
-1	I bought this bib after a lot of recommendations. I was very disappointed. First, the pocket is pretty much useless. It clings to the bib itself and doesn't catch half the food... even when it does, it's hard to get it out. It makes it very hard to clean these bibs sort of putting them in the laundry. Plus I used dish soap and let them dry out for a long time but one of the bib started to have black mold stains, and even cleaned that way they end up stinking after a day. Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when he's eating, I'd look elsewhere.
+1	Bumkin bibs are great.  They cover alot of area and the pocket catches the stray finger foods.  I wash (air dry) and it continues to look like a new bib.  This one was very colorful.  You can not find this print in the store.
+1	Read a review that covered three different bibs. They recommened the bumkin over the others..so I ordered one. So glad I did! We have tried other fabric/plastic bibs, which usually get crunchy or crusty with use and washing. The bumkin is so soft and easy to clean and dries quickly. It has a long strip of velcro for adjustable sizing. The bumkin junior bib with sleeves is a bit bigger for when my baby girl gets older. Its much larger, difficult for them to yank off, and has large coverage.
+1	This is easy to put on my often squirmy toddler son for breakfast so that we can now go to school with clean clothes! the pictures of cats and dogs make it even more appealing and it gets the job done, is easy to clean, etc.
+1	I purchased this product for my 16 month son to use for an upcoming plane trip. We purchased the dog model of this. The product we received was very true to the picture and seems to be very high quality. The fabric is very soft and feels as though it would hold up well to a few cycles in the washer.  Initially, my son wasn't a fan of having it around his neck, but we demonstrated how it was used on ourselves and he seemed to warm up to the idea. Then we used in the car a few times when he was about to zonk out.  Overall, it is a little big for him, but not enough for it to be completely useless. He is a toddler, so I'm hoping he can grow into and get a few years of good use out of it.  I will say while it's been helpful in the car, it doesn't completely eliminate that 'head forward hang' that sometimes happens when he falls asleep and slumps over.  This seems to help a bit so that it doesn't seem quite as uncomfortable, but doesn't solve the issue completely. That said, I don't blame this as that is more an issue of the car seat dimensions.Overall, we've been very happy with this and my son has enjoyed carrying it around with him. I think this will be a great purchase for upcoming trips!
+1	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.
+1	This neck pillow is both soft and cute.  I think it needs a slightly less plump back/middle of the pillow, because it kinda pushes the head forward, which didn't seem very comfortable for my son.
-1	All it does is push my 3.5 yo son's head forward.  We have to put the neck pillow towards the front and try to prop our son's head on it while he sleeps, but then have it fall when he moves his head.  Not worth it.
+1	I bought this up an up coming trip to the states from Europe, and my 5 year old won't leave it alone! I had to take it away from him to make sure he wouldn't distroy it before we left on our trip. The stuffing was getting weak in an area that he liked to bend it. Its not an everyday toy...so I just keep it up when we are not traveling.
+1	My 3-yr old loves his new alligator travel pillow! Can't wait to put it to the real test this upcoming 4-day weekend!
-1	We bought this product for a 2000-mile road trip with our 14-month old.  We found it was too thick to be helpful in keeping her head propped up in a good position as she slept to prevent wheezing.  If we put it around the back or sides of her neck, her head would fall forward and her breathing wouldn't be smooth.  If we put it around the front of her neck, it wouldn't stay put or she would pull it off.  On the positive side, it worked reasonably well for me and my 16.5-inch neck, but we will be looking into something more wedge-shaped that goes around the front of the neck for the next trip with our toddler.
+1	works great. it isn't too heavy, it folds up small enough to fit into diaper bag. would recommend to friends
+1	I used this product a lot when breastfeeding in public. It's very discreet and it has a very good size (not too big, not too small). The fabric quality is excellent and I like the fact that I could secure it behind my neck very easily so it wouldn't fall and I could still see my baby's face while nursing. Besides using it as a nursing cover up I used it as a sun shade all the time. It was very easy to secure it to the infant car seat canopy.
+1	I didn't want to write a review about this bench until it had been used for a while.  I started potty training my son with The First Years flush n' sounds potty.  That was horrible.  It stuck to his butt when he sat on it, and it always made a red ring on him.  How uncomfortable.  Plus he was big for his age and he just didn't fit on it.  So I checked like all over and found this bench.  It was comfortable for him to sit on and I didn't have to worry about him getting hurt from it.  He loved the compartments to put his toys and books in. He was potty trained at about 2.5 and now at 3.5 he still uses it sometimes and he still fits.The reason I didn't give it five stars is, like others, I didn't like the splash guard.  I didn't like it because I had to work every time to close the lid properly, and we always use it as a step stool.  But the good thing was the whole was big enough that I just taught my son to "tuck" it in so we didn't have a mess.  That was very easy for him to catch on to so it was no big deal to not use the splash guard.  Now I'm starting to use this bench to train my boy/girl twins and they both love to sit on it.  They're 20 months and my boy understands that he needs to "tuck" his in too so it's still not a problem.It is big, but that's okay with me.  Just a couple of times I didn't get to clean it out before my son moved it (and I mean picked it up) to use it as a stool and we had a mess.  Good thing it's easy to clean.
+1	I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and used it as just a bench until she was 21months. Potty training has been a breeze so far! The side compartments are great for storing extra underwear and clothes! Which I do often since I take the potty to the sitters house! It is the perfect height for her to get on and off of by herself and the pull out drawer makes for easy clean up! I couldn't do without it! Thank you Boon for making potty training a little smoother!!
+1	this is one of those things you buy and will never see.  It's pasted under the car seat and in theory it's protecting the seat from long term chafing from the car seat.  All I can say is it fit our suv well and was simple and easy to use.  The front pocket on it is a nice touch
+1	We now own four of these for two cars and two kids.  The first one worked so well we're sticking w/the same design for all.  No marks at all left in our leather seats, cleans up very well.  The front edge comes down over the edge of the seat in our Honda Accord and protects the seat from our daughter's muddy shoes when she climbs into her carseat.  With how tightly you need to anchor a car seat down to be properly secured, our car seats would certainly have been marred but there are no marks or dents under these car seat savers.
+1	This has saved the seats in all of our cars from getting ruined by mud, snacks and other accidents.  It fits well under the booster seats that we have and is just big enough not to hang down too far.
-1	I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product. The designs will not show up on dark walls and even if your ceiling is painted white, the images are still fuzzy. It is also perplexing to find a place to sit this product AND allow the baby to actually see the designs that will show up on the ceiling/wall. There should be more slides that come with the product or the availability to purchase more slides according to the baby's age.The good points of this product are that it tilts so that one can TRY to find a space for the lights to project and you have 4 choices of music to choose from. The music is soothing.
+1	I purchased this toy while I was pregnant with my son. I started using it while he was only a few weeks old. Although I'm not sure how well an infant eyes are, he did seem to look up at the lights occasionally, but he mostly liked the music at this age. Once he started rolling over and sitting on his own this toy became one of his favorites. While he was younger the color and shapes of the actual toy seemed to keep him happy, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on. Once he started sitting it was the stripped handle that kept his attention as he would flip it back and forth, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on, soon he learned to turn it on on purpose. It wasn't until around 9 months that I put it in his room at night for the light show. He loved it immedietly, and although he preferrred to roll on his tummy to sleep he started falling asleep on his back watching his light show. Soon I found a way to attach it to his crib with some cable ties, and since then he happily turns this toy on whenever he needs it! Sometimes I hear it him turn it on in the middle of the night on the baby monitor. Now at 18 months my son still plays with this toy daily. Before bed, before naps, and fist thing in the morning! It is still attached to his crib and he happily turns the music on and switches between the sounds, I have it set to play for 5 minutes, and I haven't replaced the batteries yet! I have the fish aquarium also attached to his crib and it runs out of battery power weekly with less use, and now even after I put new batteries in the fish he just assumes it doesn't work and doesn't even bother trying anymore.Pros:*By far the best crib toy we've had. Well worth it!*Baby loves it!*Soothes him to sleep (boring to us, not to him)he loves the music and and light show, but not over stimulating*Comforting, and easy to take along on trips or the sitters house (we used it on a 16 hour flight)*Excellent battery life! Used daily for the last 18 months, set to play for 5 minutes and have yet to replace the batteries!*My child still prefers the simpliest of shapes designed for the youngest child.Cons: *No crib attachment, (however we attached securely with cable ties, however cable ties will need to be cut and replaced to change batteries)*Wall images won't be very vibrante in a bright room (my son never seemed to care) we could always see them although sometimes faint*Images may seem somewhat blurry on a high ceiling, or if not on a flat surfuce.*Wish there was a remote control to use while baby was still to young to turn off and on himself. But he learned quickly.*Wish there were additional design discs to purchase.
+1	I had been looking for a mobile when I read soothers are better and the music plays for a bit longer. My son (then 3 months), would refuse to sleep on his own when put to bed, I'd had to carry him until he fell asleep in my arms. The very first night I used this I knew I had bought a life saver. I didn't like the first two slides very much so I just went right ahead and skipped to the last one (clouds, bees and stars) and he was staring at ceiling as if in a trance while the music played softly (it has 3 volume settings). After a few months, he would push the buttons himself and lay in the crib,listening and looking at the lights. I love this product! It's been almost a year since I bought it and I still use it. My son's so used to it that when he hears it, he knows it's time to relax and go to sleep. The only negative thing I could think of is that the "nature sounds" are not very loud, very hard to hear (sometimes I thought the battery had died until I pressed another button). All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone and in fact, I'm buying a second for a friend who's having her first baby soon.
+1	This was a Christmas gift for my 13 month old niece. She immediately took to it and loves taking the pieces out of the barn. She is still working on getting them back in. It definitely holds her attention.
+1	This was a big hit with both my boys (4&1) they were fighting over it when it arrived and still love it
+1	The toy was a hit with my 6month old son right away. He likes to put the animal in the mouth but now at 9months he has learnt to match the shapes and colors. Only complain is that the door broke within less than a month.
-1	To get to the letters after you place them in the barn you must remove all the animals to open the barn door. My son gets frustrated with having to remove them. The letters seam really cheap on the toy. They are super light weight but also had bits of plastic sticking up. The toy just doesn't hold his interest. He has several other shape sorters that he loves. This one just isn't a hit. He likes animals and barns but this toy just doesn't hold the 'it' factor for him.
+1	Love the price of these lined baskets to go with the changing table I bought from a friend.  They fit perfectly and love the various colored ribbons that are included to change the use and appearance of the baskets.  Love Amazon.
+1	These are perfect for my daughter's nursery to hold diapers and some of her stuffed animals.  They are sturdy and I loved how I could pick different bow colors.  I recommend these.
+1	Let me start by saying these are great! I have mine on the first of 2 shelves on my changing table and want to get another set eventually for the bottom shelf.Pros -1) Huge size, triple the size of some other character printed nursery baskets I had previously purchased! Those probably will be used to store some items under the baby's crib until he's old enough to really get into things on the floor. These ones are much nicer.2) Appearance - very classy looking. The ribbon colors are more vibrant in person. I'm having a boy and couldn't decide between the green, the blue, or the plain white. Great thing is even though I chose green for now I can change my mind later on!Cons -1) When they arrived, both baskets had problems with the holders that hold the ribbons into place ("belt loops," if you will, there's about 6 of them if they aren't ripped). One belt loopy was completely ripped off on one basket. On the other basket, the same one in the same position was only sewn on the top so I just ripped it off myself to make it match the other. This wasn't a big enough deal for me to send them back, though.No other cons so far. I feel these are a great value and are at a great price at 19.99 I bought mine with a TY Pluffies monkey toy to qualify for free shipping. :)
+1	I have a three year old and a 7 month old, and I prefer using the carts with the car in the front for my toddler, so she doesn't run off.  However, there are no safety straps up top for my 7 month old.  She is able to sit up, but I prefer her to have extra stability in a shopping cart.This worked beautifully.  I could &#34;drive&#34; my toddler around the store, while my baby was securely strapped in her seat, unable to chew on the bars, or fall over and knock her head.  Our shopping trips are so much easier now!
+1	This is one of those products I ran across on Amazon and ordered on a whim.  I'm so glad I did!  I have 12 month old twins and have had the straps for about 3 months.  We use them as makeshift highchairs at friends' houses, during holiday dinners, at restaurants, in shopping carts...  anywhere they need to be restrained comfortably.  This is such a simple, brilliant invention.  Lightweight and two fit in my diaper bag.  I wish they folded up so that the velcro was secured, since th velcro something snags other things in my bag, but that's a minor complaint.Conclusion: Buy these for your kids and for every baby you know!!!
+1	This is a convenient, portable accessory that keeps our granddaughter sitting snugly and comfortably in various chairs and seats, including strollers, high chairs, and grocery carts. We have used this product (as well as one of another brand) at home, in stores, and in restaurants ever since our girl started to sit up.
+1	Worked great for my baby. I mainly used it for when we were somewhere that did not have highchairs. I would just strap her in the middle of a regular chair and it kept her there perfect. It worked great in shopping carts too!
+1	Works great.  Easy to carry in my purse for whenever I need it.  Easy and fast to put on shopping cart.  Great product![...]
+1	Love this! it works wonderfully on shopping carts, keeps my son from sliding all over the place. I love that it is wider than traditional cart seat belts.
+1	I find this to be one of the most helpful items I have. I did the big shopping cart cover but my baby was happy to lean forward to bite on the bars or lean to the side. I also felt a little conspicuous putting the big kind on a shopping cart and dealing with the baby at the same time. This strap has fixed both those issues. I keep it in my big purse. I walk in the store and place the baby in the cart. I can then quickly remove from my purse and have my baby strapped in before the next person comes for a cart. I seem so much smoother as a mom now. It also helps keep my little girl sitting straight up and not leaning forward or the side. She does not mind it at all. At the end when dealing with the groceries and the baby I simply pull it off and slip it into my purse. People stop me while shopping to comment on it. Yes my baby can put her hands on the germy areas of the cart but at least now she can't put her mouth on anything.
+1	My 10 month old is in the 95th percentile for weight.  Shopping cart safety belts rarely fit him properly, if at all. The Leachco Safety Strap has made shopping with the baby so much easier, safer, and more comfortable for my baby.  I have tried using the safety strap on a regular chair, as suggested, and find that it does work, but I feel compelled to keep one hand on my child at all times, because it would be easy for him to wriggle off the side of the chair and slip out of the strap.
+1	We just got this today so I can't comment on how it holds up over time, but I will say that it was a breeze to install.  I was a bit worried about the pressure mount because it was going to be between a wall and a bookshelf, but it's working out perfectly!  With the bigger extension, it fits like a glove and seems really sturdy.  I foresee much tripping over the lower bar in the future but that's the price I pay for wanting a swing-open gate.EDIT:  It's been nearly six months and even after being opened dozens of times each day and having a toddler hanging all over it from time to time it's holding up really well.  But do regularly check that it's installed tight enough, we usually adjust it every few weeks or so because it loosens slightly with use.
+1	This is one of a few gates I currently have at my house.  I had a couple of Munchkin (The Auto Close) which are great but would require multiple extensions to fit this one doorway so I looked for another product and visually they are pretty close.  Installation is also very similar, the part that differs is that the Munchkin gates come with a wrench and that makes it A LOT easier to install.  And the bars on the Munchkin are also straight and not curved on the side like this Dreambaby gate.  That makes a huge difference as on this one you have to hand tight it and with a bar that curves towards your hands, it gets very tricky, especially at the bottom ones.  Once installed it works well.  Maybe if I ever get one more I'll use a rubber wrench to install it, I got mad at how my hand hurt after I installed this Dreambaby gate.
-1	The weld on this gate broke after 4 months of use!  I was surprised based on what this gate costs.  I won't be getting this gate again!
+1	Love this gate.  It installed relatively easily.  I did not screw it into the wall, just used the adhesive cups.  So far it has withstood my twins climbing on it and trying to open the gate latch without success!  I had a 53&#34; opening and it fit perfectly.
+1	This gate was placed at the bottom of stairs. we did not want to drill the banister and wanted to match the color of the stair balusters. ideal was powder black but we couldnt find it. plus it was hard to find a wide one. Installation was easy and it looked nice. However, the latch doent click properly. i could not get the two parts click precisely. Not a big deal you just push it to close it. Another drawback i see is the compatibility with the banister kit. The banister kit slips on the banister because our banister is round and thinner on top. Is this gate perfect? No. But, considering all the different specifications of doorways and stairs of homes, probably this is the best we could get from the consumer product market.
-1	We couldn't even install this gate, because it arrived warped - the door of the gate would not close, because it was not level with the lock. Does this company ever check the quality of their products? For the price they are asking for it, there should be a much, much better quality control. I am extremely disappointed with this gate. Obviously, it is going back ASAP!!!!!
+1	We love this gate and have been using it for nearly 2 years now.  Exactly what we were looking for and blends in with our decor perfectly.
+1	Our family room is a converted garage with french doors, so the doorway is 4 ft wide and I needed something sturdy that would still allow the doors to close if needed. This is perfect. I applied a lot of pressure on it, and it didn't budge. The door is easy to open for an adult, but not for a child since you have to lift and open at the same time. I like that it closes and latches on its own too.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because we used the larger extension and the holes for the connecting piece on the bottom weren't perfectly lined up, so there's a small gap between the bottom of the extender piece and the floor. It's very small, maybe about a cm, but still a slight annoyance. Otherwise it was fairly simple to put together and install.
+1	Ok gate, my son figure it out how to open it at 18 mo old, so went to plan B and did tie a scarf on the lower part of the door to keep it shut! Overall sturdy but you can find better considering Customer Service does not exist in USA, Canada only without toll free number, not good!!!!
+1	i really loved it but you should know that it does seem to fill up a queen size bed. and hubby may feel a little robbed of his side of the bed. it was too firm for me at the top, i need a slighter softer pillow for my head. i always woke up with a cinked neck when i used the head part. but if you are having acid reflux and you need to elevate your back, put a head pillow on top of the head part of this thing and it helps (a little) to keep the acids down... but you will be sleeping in a slanted slightly upward position.
+1	This product makes sleeping possible when your body is sore and sleeping on your side feel awkward and uncomfortable.  I highly recommend it!  My husband thought this was a silly and unnecessary way to spend money, and now he agrees with me that it was a necessity.  You will not regret Snoogle Loop!
-1	I'm 5 months pregnant and was looking for a body pillow that would help me sleep comfortably on my side as I'm primarily a back sleeper. After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back.  Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams.  I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body.  It did do the job in keeping me sleeping on my side but I just wish it was softer and more comfortable.
+1	I have been using this pillow since I was about 14 weeks pregnant to "practice" and get used to sleeping on my side.  Now that I am 20 weeks pregnant, I have been using it every night and it has been so helpful and my back pain is gone, and I can sleep on my side all night, and easily switch from side to side.  I origianlly bought a preggle which I like, but if I wanted to change sides, I had to move the pillow.  This is soooo much better and I don't know how anyone can get through pregnancy without this.  I was a stomach sleeper before!  A must have and worth every penny!
+1	Bought this for my wife when we first found out we were expecting, and she loves it. After some encouragement from my wife, I tried it, and to be completely honest...I want one now too.
+1	Overall, this is a great pillow and I highly recommend it.Gives support from head to toe (I'm 5'5" and sleep with knees slightly bent; my top foot stays elevated with this pillow) -- most others on the market are too short to do that. Provides back support, and prevents me from rolling on my back when I sleep (which was a big concern). It's a little firm - but you're sleeping on your side, so you want your neck supported. The c-shape also makes it easier to get in/out of bed than if it didn't have the opening in the middle (ie, I don't have to climb over it). It's not even as big as I'd expected - in fact, my hubby and dogs still fit comfortably with me in our king-sized bed, with room to spare.Two minor drawbacks were already mentioned in other reviews - both have to do with the cover. First, the fabric is a little scratchy (feels like a cotton/poly blend). Second, the inside seams are pulled too tight, so you have to adjust sleeping positions (in order not to have it dig into your neck). I'll probably just end up making myself a new slipcover with softer fabric, and adjusting the seams to allow a little more give/room.
+1	At 23 weeks pregnant, I out of nowhere noticed significant mid-back pain while sleeping on my side and decided it was time to look into a pregnancy pillow. I analyzed all of the reviews of multiple different pregnancy pillows, and decided on this one based on the fact that it seemed to provide more support than others. Here's a breakdown of how this pillow works for me:PROS:- This pillow provides INCREDIBLE support for pregnant women. I noticed immediately that my back pain was alleviated. Additionally, I didn't realize that I needed stomach support so early on at 24 weeks, but this provides just the right amount of cushion and helped me feel better instantly.- My arms, legs and hips no longer hurt from sleeping on my side. My arms don't fall asleep, and my legs feel fully supported.- I went from horrible choppy sleep to the soundest sleep ever instantly. I seriously lay down on my side in this pillow and wake up 7-8 hours later completely rested. The reason is because the pillow fully surrounds you and you feel enveloped in cushy warmth - it's hard NOT to get a good night's rest with this pillow.CONS (sort of):- The pillow is massive. My husband and I joke that it's like wrestling a fluffy alligator, but it's actually not a problem at all in our king size bed. If you share the bed with your partner in anything smaller than a king, I think this pillow would be too bulky.- It's a little hard to turn from one side to the other because of how the pillow is shaped and how you wrap yourself in it. But once you do get to the other side, you're out like a light bulb again instantly.Others mentioned feeling like the inside seam is too tight, but I haven't had that problem. When you touch it, you can definitely tell that it's sewn tightly, but it doesn't provide any discomfort for me at night. I'm 5'10, but I think the fact that my torso is on the shorter side works in my favor here. I had my husband try lying down in it (he's 6'1), and he noticed the seam a bit, but didn't think it was bothersome.I tried another pregnancy pillow while traveling recently (Boppy Custom Fit Body Pillow), and hated it. I immediately missed my Snoogle Loop and had only wished there were a way to take it with me while traveling. The Boppy was all the local store had, and it was several nights of miserable, unsupported sleep.The Snoogle Loop is large and a bit more expensive than others, but I cannot recommend this pillow highly enough for anybody who is pregnant or needs support for sleeping on their sides. I am nearing the 3rd trimester and still sleeping like a baby, and I owe it all to this pillow.
+1	I lived this! I used it the whole time I was pregnant. It really takes the pressure off your hips and thighs when you sleep on your side, and gives you support for your belly as it gets bigger. We have a queen size bed and it only took up my half. It does compress as you use it, making it less supportive. There is also an annoying tag, but I guess you could cut it off.
+1	ABSOLUTELY recommended investment!I had a lot of water retention & backaches from the first weeks of my pregnancy, making it hard to lie in bed.  So I decided to invest in this pillow.  And let me tell you... BEST sleep given the discomforts of pregnancy. I've been using it from the first couple of weeks of pregnancy till now (34+ weeks).So if you can afford it, do invest in it. I'll pack it away for my next pregnancy when I'm done in a few weeks :) (i'A)Pros:1. Very cushioned and an absolute dream that supports your back, belly, and everything else.  Dream to hug it and sleep on whichever side.2. Alleviates the aches & pains of pregnancy.Cons:1. No idea how you can put the cover back on after washing! Its not zippered.  And you'd actually have to snake it through. I think that's impossible.2. The place where your shoulder rests is small and a little tight. But I use a pillow to rest my head & shoulders. You can do without the pillow too. But its good to be a little propped up during late pregnancy, due to acid reflux.3. Its pretty BIG! We have a King bed so, its not an issue other than my husband misses hugging me at night - he'll say every night. Because all its poofiness (lol) gets in the way & is a major barrier!
+1	I got this to help ease my back pain. It's true that you can sleep on both your sides when you use it and still support your back but your belly will be squeezed and your legs will get numb of you change sides. The shoulder area is not tight. I had to place a pillow under the head area to relieve the pressure on my shoulders
-1	I ordered this hoping to get a better nights sleep, but it obviously wasn't made for someone of my stature. I'm 6'1&#34; and my knees hung off this pillow and my neck was being squeezed by the seam at the top. So uncomfortable. I think it would work for women who are 5ft to about 5ft8in and that's it. Don't buy if you're tall like me. Also, it felt very claustrophobic trying to sleep with it as well. I could only stand it for like 2 hours the first night I tried it. Super uncomfortable!
+1	We bought this because once our baby was a toddler we no longer needed to bring along blankets, bottles, and all that baby stuff. I can easily fit 3 size 6 diapers and some wipes in one pouch and a thin (anything summery or PJS in winter) extra outfit in the other. The pad is extra nice and the clip makes this easy to attach to our old diaper bag, which now is full with baby sisters stuff! The front zipper area fits my wallet, keys, and phone when I go out with just my toddler.
+1	I really like this changing pad. I feel so much better changing my son on public tables when I use it. It's easy to unravel and re-fold using only one hand. It also fits perfectly in the outer pocket of my diaper bag. My only critique is that the red wipes case that it comes with has been leeching dye into his baby wipes, so I'd recommend using a different wipe container.
+1	This is great.  I can throw it in any diaper or non-stop diaper bag.  Dad can grab it & change baby and not have to take everything else with him.  The only con, wipes do trend to dry out if not used everyday..but that's not really an issue on not to get this.  I'm am pleased with it.
+1	Ok.  As new dad, I can tell you this is great.  I'm not metrosexual enough for a diaper bag, even one that is somewhat masculine.  I do keep one in the trunk for emergencies.Having said that, I love this thing.  It's easy to pack essentials for changing, and my wife and I have used it so many times - back seat of our car, in a courtyard, on a family member's bed.  Plenty of room to store newborn or size 1 diapers.  Plenty of room for wipes, hand cleaner and diaper creme.There's a stap to attach it to your stroller, if you don't want to put it in the basket.
+1	I love having this for road trips because I don't have to haul a whole diaper bag into the rest areas. It is great for toddlers when they don't need as much stuff except for diapers and wipes. I don't use the wipes case, I just throw in a small pack of wipes and it works fine. I have been able to fit in 5 diapers, a small bottle of hand sanitizer, and a light change of clothes (onsie and leggings).
+1	Love this diaper bag. All the essentials for a quick trip anywhere. I throw it in my hiking back and take my little one hiking with me, good for a half day trip. Throw it in the truck anytime she is around. Its black, discrete, and extremely functional. Love the changing pad.... comes in very handy. Can't say enough about this.
+1	This little bag does all you'd expect - carries your essentials - easy access - fast clean up - simple change mat - looks discreet. Carry it within a larger bag, attach it to a stroller or hold it in your hand. Its a simple design that works for me and my newborn when all you require is a spare nappy, baby wipes and a Bonds wondersuit.
+1	I like the idea of this small diaper bag that can be stuck in a purse or just carried. A few things could be improved, but overall it is useful and a decent price for what you get.Pros: It is well constructed and holds all the essentials.  The diaper pocket holds 2 cloth diapers for me (BG AIO's).  The wipes case holds plenty of wipes.Cons: I wish the outside zipper pocket held more, my wallet is a little large and barely fits.  As far as utility, it's a little heavier than I expected, and I don't like the idea that the area that would lay on the floor/diaper changer would be "exposed" to the inside of my purse/bag if I put this inside another one.
+1	I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars b/c it's kind of bulky with everything I need in all of its available products. But, we still like it!
+1	It's a nice and stylish changing kit. It fits diapers, gloves, small garbage bags, and wipes. Overall it's a great product and durable. I gave only 4 stars cause the red wipe case turns my pamper wipes red when I first used it.
+1	I love this for travel or quick changes when we're home - we live in a 3 story townhome and after my c-section I couldn't go up & down stairs. We keep this on the lower level so I could change my son easily. It's a nice big area - it doesn't hold enough if you're going out all day long (for a newborn anyways). But at the park or traveling (I HATE public restrooms and will not go in there to change my son lol!!) it's perfect.
+1	We are very happy with this.  It holds up to 8 small diapers, extra wipes, and a small outfit.  Rather than having a desginated diaper bag, we just throw this into whatever is appropriate for the outing, a tote bag, the stroller basket, my shoulder bag, along with toys, nursing cover and burp cloth and we are ready to go.  Only drawback is that it might not hold a full days supply of diapers when she is bigger and the diapers are bigger!
+1	This is super handy to have for diaper changes on the go. Often, I'll leave the bigger bag in the car, and only car this with me in and out of stores, etc. It has enough room to store wipes, a few disposable diapers, and a back up onesie. I only wish the side flaps were wider, to deter exploring tiny hands form reaching beyond the mat and touching other things.
-1	Wanted to love this but the zipper broke after 2 months (& a handful of uses at that.)  Just emailed customer service, we'll see how that goes, from other reviews on here I'm not hoping for much.
+1	The quality is fair and I love the design.  Unfortunately, I found the item on sale on different websites for a lot less after I ordered the changer...
+1	Awesome! It can go down on a park bench, over a changer @ restroom. Holds more diapers than any other changer. Fits in a larger purse if not bringing diaper bag. Fits about 5-7 NB diapers, a larger wipes container and a NB onesie as well.
+1	I have no idea how people survived without the Skip Hop diaper changing bag!  Large enough to accommodate various surfaces (and babies) yet compact enough to fit in many purses.  Perfect when we're out - I often grab it out of the diaper bag and hand off to by husband to do a change!  Fits a generous amount of wipes and diapers and is quite durable.  I've been using mine on a daily basis for 10 months and it doesn't look any different from the day I opened it.  Great value for how often you will use this product!
+1	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you!  No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).  The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.
+1	This has become our go to diaper changing product while we are on the go. It's compact and fits into larger day bags which turns any bag into a diaper bag. The clip is also handy. We often hang it off of the waist strap of our carrier for a hands free solution.
+1	I like the overall look of this travel diaper bag. It's only great for short trips or doctor's visits because it doesn't hold that many diapers. But it's easy to travel with, especially when you are already holding a million things in your hands, arms and maybe legs too!Warning: the red baby wipe travel case that came with the product dyed my baby wipes red! I have no idea why, but good thing I have so many of those wipe travel cases I just replaced it with another one. Problem solved.
+1	This review is for the Skip-Hop Pronto and is from daddy's perspective.  This was my bag of choice when taking my baby daughter to day trips to the museum, beach, friends, Grandma's, etc.  I really liked the bag and used it for over a year as my daughter was still just wee.  Below are the main points I can speak to from my experience:Pros*  Size - This size was just perfect for day trips.  It held a travel-size package of wipes, a few infant diapers (or a couple of bigger ones), and a couple of tubes of hand sanitizer, bottom balm, etc.  I loved the fact that it all condensed down into a small sized satchel that could be tossed under the compact stroller or hung on the handle without taking up a lot of space or getting in the way.  I always kept a larger, fully stocked diaper bag in the mother-ship (car) where room and space weren't as much an issue.  I thought the size of this was perfect for on-the-go short adventures.*  Function - I really  liked the fold out pad.  Though my daughter didn't really care about its aesthetics, I liked the pattern on the changing pad.  Its surface was smooth which made it really easy to clean.  Most importantly, it had nice padding that kept my daughter comfy while I went about the diaper business.  The padding wasn't very thick, but it seemed to be effective against hard surfaces.  Also, I liked the size of the changing pad - I found that there was plenty of room for baby. The case had plenty of areas for storage for its size.*  Quality - Mine held up very well with frequent use over time.  I saw other reviews that indicated quality problems and that's too bad.  I bought mine in Fall of 2007, so perhaps the company changed manufacturers or materials that led to some shoddiness.Cons*  Price - I chose this over other, similar on-the-go diaper bags because I thought it had better styling and I thought the set-up was a little more functional.  That being said, it was pricier than most others - sometimes significantly.  It could probably be cheaper.*  Size - I'm not sure this is a con, but some people would probably find that it's just too small.  The opening for the wipes is a tight fit.  I never had a problem with it and never considered it a problem.  Some have noted that you can fit fewer larger diapers vs. infant-sized diapers.  Well, yeah.  Just like you get fewer #4 diapers vs. newborn diapers in a package of the same size.  I don't see this as a negative, as by the time my daughter was wearing #4 size diapers she was also going less frequently and more predictably than when she was in the infant size.  One of the things I liked about this changing bag was that it was small; if I wanted something that would carry the same number of large-size diapers, I would just have lugged around my backpack-style diaper bag.  Which is the point:  This is a very compact bag, suitable - in my experience - for outings that lasted hours, not days.Final ThoughtsI should also mention that I found the small plastic wipes case that came with the bag to be useless and just tossed it; travel-sized wipes packages are the perfect size for this bag and are usually resealable.  Also, getting rid of the hard plastic case saves space and adds flexibility to the bag, in my opinion.  Others may feel differently, but I didn't think the plastic case added any value.In the end, I used this bag more than any other and really liked it, and can recommend it based on that experience.  It is specialized, though, and not something that you'd take on an extended trip.  For this daddy it was perfect, but that may not be true of others.  I would rate the product five stars based on style, functionality, and size, but feel compelled to knock off a star for price.  Saving ten bucks here or there can buy a lot of wipes, you know?
+1	I can't stand lugging around a huge bag and refused to buy a diaper bag - I found this works just as well. It has a detachable changing pad and fits 3-6 diapers plus lotions and a spare outfit. I breastfed so I didn't need any room for bottles, etc.  You can pop this into any other tote and it works great.  I store it in the front of my Maclaren stroller and it's the perfect size and weight - I have no issues with tipping the stroller over with a huge & heavy bag.
+1	Love this! Carried all the essential gear to change my little one on the go. Converts any bag into a diaper bag, husband was willing to carry it, detachable and washable pad was a nice feature, great shape to cover flip down diaper stations. Minus one star as I would reverse the net pocket and the zippered pocket, I have a long baby and would rest his head where the zippered pocket is, so I kept the diapers there so it was soft instead of a hard wipes container or ointment. We are more minimalist now so this lives in the car to turn the back of our station wagon into a change station.
+1	This diaper changing kit is exactly as I expected. It's very practical, enough pockets for other items. The color also is an additional bonus to  the look of this diaper changing clutch.
+1	I bought this to take on a plane with my little one.  Although I also had a full diaper bag with me, I knew that taking the diaper bag to the airplane restroom with me and carry the baby would be too difficult. Not to mention that airplane restrooms aren't exactly roomy.  The kit worked really well for quick diaper changes on the plane.  I like the carrying strap on it that I can put around my wrist.  Sometimes on short outings I only carry this kit and not the full diaper bag!  It's an all-in-one diaper changer kit that makes diaper changing quick and easy!
+1	It's stylish! That's all we carry when we're out. But I wish the pad is a bit longer. At 6 month, my baby's bum is now at the edge of the pad, so I don't know how much longer we could use it. It would be better if the plastic wipes container has a dispensing slot like those in the wipes's tub. But overall, we're very happy with it.
+1	I love this so your kid can actually fall asleep if they have to!  Takes a little getting use to with one hand but after 3x you get it.
+1	Walmart, sams club, Burlington coat, tjmaxx, etc. this cover fits all sized carts.  why dont more moms use these!?ive had this for over a year. my son is now 17 months old and i still use this. i had no idea i would religiously use this. i use this constantly! he constantly wanted to chew on the shopping cart handle and this is a great sanitary barrier for that. think about it..most viruses come from the shopping carts! since i started hand sanitizing before and after i go to the grocery store with awareness never to touch my face i have avoided getting sick dramatically. so much that i felt having this cart cover was even more important..during the young stages where he still wasnt able to sit up the pillows helped him. he fell asleep in the shopping cart a few times and the pillows came in handy. the toy tethers are a must! its quick and easy to just throw onto the cart.i would honestly label this as a must have for an expectant mother for several reasons. this one specifically has the best features ive seen yet!
+1	Love that the cover has the pillows on the side for the grocery store trips but hard to use in highchairs.  (I just bring a different cover in the car for eating out)  Folds up great and attaches to the shopping cart over the handle so I can put snacks there.  Great cover
+1	I searched high and low for a shopping cart cover for my daughter. She is just under 6 months old and isn't quite sitting up on her own. I asked a lot of friends and family about their covers and what they liked and didn't like. I read numerous reviews on here and I was hesitant to order this cover because the of the negative reviews regarding its size. I took this to Wal-mart and got a big size cart (in my area they are all large).  I put it in the seating area and my oh my it fit perfectly! It covered everything! I just can't say enough good things about this cover! I have no idea what those negative reviews are talking about. It is very cute, soft and feels like it will easy to clean. I love the toy hooks too. Just so many great things, possibly one of my favorite baby products I've bought so far.
+1	My daughter likes grocery shopping so much better now that she can sit up in her comfy little cart seat rather than being stuck in her baby car seat.  It's true that it is not big enough for to cover the handle on the bigger carts at some stores, including our regular grocery store, but it still gives her a soft little place to sit so I don't mind at all.
+1	My little one gets so excited now when I pull this out of the car to go to the store. I started her in it when she was 6 months. I feel so comfortable with her in the cart now with the side cushions.
+1	I looked at a lot of cart covers, and I am very happy with this one.  I'm not sure about the reviews saying it doesn't fit on carts, I can't imagine how it wouldn't fit other then not being able to use the back pockets if the seat has a higher back. but the pockets are really just  small bonus, so not being able to use them in some shopping carts is really no big deal at all.The material is very nice, the pillows are so soft, no more worrying about my son chewing on the cart handle!  I really think he could just take a nap while I'm shopping.I have used this cover at the following stores, and it fit perfectly with no issues at allWalmart,Food Lion,Army Commissary (not sure if the all use the same carts)
+1	Just bought this for my 9.month-old and we love it. it is super comfortable and since she is only 9 months old the side cushions are very good for her to feel more protected.
+1	this is great and really simple to use. easy to put in the cart and this works great for my 6 month old who cant quite sit up entirely on his own in the cart yet.
+1	So worth the additional money .  I don't think that I have ever been out where someone hasn't commented or requested where I purchased this cover.  Fits great and helps keep baby upright.  You can also lay the baby across the top longways (monitored of course) to allow baby to feed or nap
+1	I get the question all the time: &#34;wow, I've never seen one that looks that comfy! Where did you get it?&#34;This is great for most shopping carts. I say most because there are some where the fit isn't quite right, but hey, we adjust and go with it. The main issue with fit is that sometimes the cover doesn't reach all the way to where I hold the cart so he can still get his hands on grub when it's not stretched out over it.I loved it when he was really little (e.g., 6 months) because the side pillows would help to keep him propped up and in the center of the seat. I still love it because it's comfortable and it has pockets in the back for anything you need (e.g., water bottle, pacifier, toys, shopping list, etc.) and it folds up with a velcro strap for easy carrying. A great product!!
+1	Easy to use, Easy to clean, Easy to store. Best one I have seen or used. I have bought a few for friends in the last couple of years. The padding on the sides helps wondeful for tired little ones or learning to sit up little ones.
+1	I was afraid to buy this because of the negative feedback but I couldn't be happier with it.  It's fit all carts fine for me and the pillows on each side are great.  My daughter is very squirmy so I'm always afraid of her hitting her head on the side of the cart but the pillows prevent her from getting hurt and from falling to the side.  The print is nice and neutral and the cover is well put together.  Love it :)
+1	My Daughter loves this thing! She is petite and at 4 1/2 months she was able to sit in the cart perfectly! I love the velcro toy straps and the pockets in the back of it. Doesn't fit perfectly in our Target carts but it does fit, I have had no issues with any other cart. Its super easy to roll back together! You can easily do it while holding baby in one arm. It also washes beautifully. I highly recommend this product and I am sooo happy I didn't buy the first one in the store. It pays to do your research and I promise you, this one will not disappoint!
+1	I have gotten so many &#34;That genius!&#34; comments about this cart cover. My son is on the smaller side of average, and the pillows keep him from slipping over sideways. He also likes to kick back and lean against them if he's tired and we're still shopping! It's easy to spot-clean, and the pillow parts come out for machine washing. Excellent, excellent product!!
+1	I read a lot of reviews for covers before deciding on this one.  The main things that I love about this cover is:-pillows are nice for my 6 month old whos not too sure of sitting up on his own yet-very easy to put in cart and pack back up one handed while holding a baby-cute fabric and nice and sturdy-toy straps so he always has something to play with and I don't have to worry about them falling or getting lost.The only draw back for me (and it's not even a huge deal for me) is that it does run a little small for larger carts...but if you play with it, you'll learn what you can do to make it work for them.I am very happy with this cover and if I have another baby...I will be happy to use it for the next one too!
-1	I wanted a cover that would protect my son from touching the germy shopping carts.  This cover was nice, however, it was bulky with the side pillows, and didn't cover the sides.  I'm much happier with the Infantino cover and recommend it over this one.
+1	This product was delivered earlier then expected, it is exactly as discribed. It fits all of the carts I have used it in. I was up very easily. It is pretty easy to put in the cart and take out and over all my child likes it and I like using it.
+1	I am a first time mom. I find myself at times overwhelmed by all the unnecessary baby gear and initially classified these cart covers as frivolous. I debated for weeks whether or not to get this because my 5 month old baby couldn't sit up by herself yet and I didn't like always having to bring her car seat in the store as it is heavy and didn't quite fit on the store shopping carts - but I was desperate. Since it was eligible for Prime, I knew I could return it hassle-free if I needed to (Amazon has a great return policy), and I bought it, hoping my baby could be propped up comfortably in the cart. It definitely props her up, and the side pillows are so easy to get on and off when I need to wash this thing. My daughter looks super comfortable in her Prop 'R Shopper. Also, there really isn't a place for her to reach and chew nasty shopping cart handles or buckles that have been handled and used by countless people. I wipe the seat and handle with alcohol wipes, place the shopping cover over the cart, and when I am done with it, it rolls into a neat little package, which I was able to remember how to fold it to get that way after trying once or twice. It has neat little Velcro straps that you can attach baby toys too. There are pockets that are behind the baby and those are really useful as well for when I want to put my wallet in there on her pacifier. It fits neatly onto most shopping carts (I haven't encountered one that was too large for this just yet) and washes beautifully. It is also gorgeous (I bought the green) ad doesn't feel cheaply made in any way.
+1	Well made durable and I love the cushioning. Especially for a younger baby or preemie like ours.I wish they had more colors/
+1	We got compliments on this shopping cart cover everywhere we went. It's cute, easy to put on/take off, it gets the job done, it allows my son to nap in the grocery cart, and most of all it's machine washable. What's not to like? :)
+1	This was so great to use for my son when he couldn't sit up by himself without support. It honestly gave me the tool I needed to take him out and run errands by myself. The big pillows on the side were great support for him. It fit traditional small and bigger (Target or Costco) sized carts. No complaints!!!!
+1	I love this cart cover. I had doubts about ordering it at first because some people said that it didn't fit bigger carts; however, it has fit every cart I tried so far. I have used it at Target, BJ's, Wal-Mart, and other places. I haven't had any issues yet. It is perfect for babies who need a little support to sit up. It has two cushions on both sides in case they topple over so the baby won't get hurt. My son is 6 months old and had to transition to a convertible car seat. That meant no more car seat base combination so I didn't have the car seat to pick up and balance in the cart. This was the perfect solution.
+1	I like it so much.I bought because of two great feactures-belt and cushions and it works very good.My baby loves soft cushions and he is safe enough with the belts.It is easy to wash and pack it,I like that it becomes a bag,easy to carry on the shoulder.Great product,recommend everyone.
+1	This cart cover makes taking my 4 month old shopping a pleasant experience.  It fits a walmart cart perfectly. The padding keeps her propped up when she falls asleep.  The toy straps keeps her toys from falling and the pockets are Suprisingly useful.
+1	Very handy and easy to use/clean.
+1	I was hesitant to buy it after reading some reviews, but I really like this product. If you're serious about potty training and want to get out of the house and resume going to the store or anywhere else, this is a great product. It sits on every toilet seat that I've tried rather nicely without any issues. My son feels secure on it. I also like the way it folds up and stores in a pouch. Sometimes, I just take the pouch out with me and that's it. No more big diaper bag if it's a quick trip somewhere. So far, so good.
+1	My kids 2-4-6 love this seat, well the 6 yr old I big for it, but he used to like it.  It's easy to transport and the padding covers hinges well, so no pinching!  It's comfortable according to them, and keeps them from falling in.  Easy to clean. Very happy  with the purchase.
+1	who knew a toilet seat could be so amazing?!  seriously tho, this has been a lifesaver for potty training.  it folds up (not as small as i'd like but still fits in the diaper bag), comes with it's own bag, is padded for comfort, and seems very sturdy.
+1	I really like this potty seat. My cousin gave me 2 and I bought a third one for Grandmas house. It is soft & folds up into its own carrying bag for travel. Easy to clean as well. My only complaint is that its a bit floppy. What I mean is that sometimes when my daughter places it on the toilet it folds in and falls into the potty. We try to just keep it in place so that don't happen. But the fact that it fits easily in my diaper bag for &#34;outings&#34; is the main reason I like it so much.
+1	This potty seat works great.  My daughter would not sit on a public toilet, especially with a protective paper cover over it.  This potty seat will fit in a good sized purse or small backpack.  It has never pinched her.  We have not had problems with it sliding around.  She happily sits on it without any complaint, which is a great stress reliever while potty training.  She calls it her special seat.  Highly recommend.
+1	I bought this and am SO glad I did!  My daughter will only use the big "potty" and not the little potty chairs, so we bought other seats to use on the toilet at home, but this is great for on the go!  Easy to use and fits in the bag perfectly!
+1	This little potty is great for when you are out and about. It comes with it's own little drawstring carrying case and it's super portable. I just drop it in my son's backpack along with his snacks and a change of underwear, and off we go!It makes me more comfortable about having him sit on public toilets. I don't have to hold him up, I can just sit him down and he can take his time.It doesn't fit perfectly on every single toilet out there, but what toilet seat does? I've never had any experiences with the seat falling or pinching my son. We've had this seat for about 9 months now.
+1	I was carting around my son's cars potty seat wrapped in a garbage sack.  This is wonderfully compact and comes in the travel bag.  Fits in my diaper bag so much better!  My son prefers to stand but when the need arises this gives him the security he needs to sit down.  We did run into many a public toilet that this didn't fit well on but I still liked having it.
+1	My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.
-1	Don't waste your money because you can't return this item.This so-called traveler toilet is not usable.  It is too small for the large typical public toilet. It is flimsy and bends frighteningly underneath small children even if you push the traveler seat all the way back so it is supported underneath the back (as per the included instructions). It slips slips slips.  I can't think of a single use for it.  Even at grandma's house we would be better off just keeping a proper toilet seat there like the Baby BjornBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer- White/ Black.We have had much better luck in public toilets using theKalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Blue.  The Kalencom is very sturdy and has good (but not perfect) non-slip grips.  It is not a perfect seat because it is not flat but our kids do not mind it a bit and we find it much easier to use.
+1	My daughter was ready to potty in public LONG before *I* was ready for her to potty in public.  This product has helped me catch up with her.  She gets to be more comfortable, and I can be less horrified that my kid is in contact with surfaces I can't bear to think about.This is not a replacement for your at home adapter, so expect to still be hands-on with your child, offering some support and stability.  My daughter is around 21 months and 25 lbs, and while I don't feel like she's going to fall in, I definitely feel better keeping my hands on her just in case.  It is a travel item, after all.  But it sure beats the butt-hover that happens without an adapter, and the folding action and the travel bag make this one a home run.  My daughter loves to carry the travel bag after she goes.  She's so proud of herself for using the big girl potty!I've already recommended it to all my potty training parent friends.  Such a great product!
-1	This seat worked a total of two times before collapsing & dumping my son in the toilet.  Worst travel toilet seat, ever.  I followed the directions, making sure it sat well back on the toilet when in use, but it still sagged every time he used it, and then it just folded inward while he was sitting on it one day.  Now he's scared to go on the "big potty" and begs me not to drop him in the potty whenever he goes.  Thanks for creating a phobia for my son, Mommy's Helper.  Don't waste your money on this product.
+1	I was a little hesitant about getting this but I am really glad I did! My little girl (2) is terrified of those huge public bathroom seats and cries every time! I wasn't sure how this seat would work on them but I am grateful that they do! Make sure the seat is positioned on the BACK of the toilet for support. It seems to be of pretty good construction and materials and my girl loves that it's padded! It comes with a carrying case which my daughter now calls her potty purse and is happy to go to the bathroom. That is a big breakthrough during the potty training stage! Would recommend, and even if it doesn't last more than 6 months at a time I will still buy another. It's cheaper than pull ups and now that she uses the public bathrooms we can go out in normal big girl underwear!
+1	This traveling potty seat is a wonderful and super helpful tool during potty training. It is soft, solid, well-made, and really helps kiddos to feel secure during those first (often anxious!) experiences going potty in a new place.Pros:1) Super soft and very comfortable. My little one did not have any problems using this.2) Folds in half twice and is VERY compact for traveling.3) Comes with a draw-string travel case to make life easierCons:1) A little too small for elongated toilets. I wish the seat were just a tad longer so that there was no risk of a mess.Fantastic tool for potty training!
+1	This comes in its own carry case, is light and fits in a diaper bag.  I used it for my daughter and then gave it to my sister to use which her boys.  They haven't used it yet but it's fantastic for taking out and about, because after all you should be able to potty train on the go.  You're out shopping and your kid has to go, you don't have the potty chair with you so what do you do?  You whip out this bad boy and show the other moms what you're made of.  I love being prepared.
+1	I knew I wanted a well-rated, good looking car seat when I was doing research for ours, and wanted something different from the standard Graco and Fisher Prices out there.  Britax consistently had great reviews and many awards so we decided to get the Roundabout.  This model is more portable for travel since we travel a lot.  We haven't traveled overseas with it yet, but we really love it so far. I also have great peace of mind that I have a car seat that exceeds U.S. safety standards.
+1	I purchased this to replace another recently purchased carseat.  The previous one had been purchased in a hurry at a local store.  It was a good brand name, so I thought all would be well.  But it wasn't!  On the previous one, the crotch strap was much TOO close to the back of the chair, making it very difficult to fasten and causing me to utter explicatives each time I did so (in my head)!So, I went to Amazon to go back to Britax.  In my main car, I have the Britax Shannon (because that is my daughter's name).  But since this car is not used very much, I wanted to spend less money if possible.I, of course, am VERY happy with this seat.  As expected, the crotch strap is in the perfect spot.  Everything is easy to do; installation, placing the baby (2 years) in the seat, and fastening her in.  And it is very comfortable for her.  And, most importantly, it is safe.I almost bought this for my daughter when her seat was damaged, but then went for the more expensive Shannon (don't remember the model) since, after all, that is her name, and she was using it in the only car she drives....AND she often goes on long trips.
+1	This is the bed rail to get if you have a mattress that sits inside a bed frame.  The hinge sits higher than the bed frame and allows you to fold the rail down when not in use or for changing sheets.This rail is solidly built and I highly recommend it!
+1	This is a simple review for a simply great product.  This rail was easy to put together, sturdy, and dropping the side was easy for me to do while pregnant, but hard enough for our 2 year old not to master.  We had trouble finding a rail that worked in bunk beds, but this one beat the competition hands down!
+1	Why this vs. Safety First Bed Rail?Size - it's all about size. This was the perfect length to cover from my son's current bed's side rail to the edge. The Safety first is great if we need 60+inches...but we didn't. They're both essentially the same product- one is just wider. I also didn't like that the safety first sat ON the mattress instead of under. Just seemed like it would be uncomfortable for my son - he likes to roll to the side/edge of the mattress and curl up.Also this was 1/2 the price of Safety First.Instructions - it's literally 8 lines - no photos, and takes some intuitive thinking on getting this thing put together. It took about 10 minutes with trial and error.Toddler bed - this didn't seem like it was made for a toddler bed b/c the anchor straps were really long and the disc went out further than the edge of the bed. With a little fiddling around and tying the strap to the slats of the bed, it works. I wouldn't recommend this product for a twin size bed - would seem like there's too much of a gap on either sides (lengthwise) for a child to fall off. I would recommend this for a toddler bed - there is just the right amount of coverage to keep a child inside (lengthwise).Suggestions - I wish that this was taller (in height). It's enough to keep my child in when he's sleeping - but it doesn't deter him from wanting to climb over it when he's awake. Not that we're trying to keep him in - he thinks it's a toy/climbing wall. So he'll try to climb form the outside into his bed, or vice versa.It's sturdy that I'm not worried about him knocking it over or rolling out (our mattress is a standard size - I would suggest putting in the safety bar - which sits at the same heigh as the mattress. Rather be safe than sorry (our mattress is a few inches shorter than they suggested instructions).You definitely get a good value for the $$ - there's no point paying $40 for another bed rail if you don't need the length. And it's about the same height (from the mattress as Safety First).
+1	The BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover is everything advertised and more!  It's absolutely true that you can easily place it into the cart, unzip it and set it up with just one hand.Not only was set up a breeze, but the amount of padding on this cover is amazing.  My 8-month-old sits up but is still wobbly sometimes.  When she launched herself backward in the seat she didn't even notice because of both the regular padding in the cover and the great pillow (that comes attached with velcro) which padded her back.  She was also snugly and securely belted into the seat cover.  I love the padding and velcro that attach to the center pole of the shopping cart as well (where you put the child's legs through).Everything was obviously carefully and insightfully planned and implemented in this product.  The added features of zippered pockets, tabs for toys, and fabric covered elastic holders for juice and bottles inside the cart area is fantastic.  Plus the bright fun print is very cute and interesting to look at for the babies.  I couldn't recommend this product more highly.  If you're looking for a really good cart cover this is it.
+1	This is one snazzy shopping cart cover.  One lady referred to it as a "totally fabulous situation" when she came up to us in the store and gestured to it.This cart cover COVERS everything!  Your baby will not touch anything on the actual cart.  Any licking or chewing will happen to the cart cover only, THANK GOODNESS.The pillow is nice, helps stabilize littler babies, protects bigger ones from having accidents with their faces hitting the front bars of the carts.  And it is tethered to the cover, so when baby thinks it would be funny to launch it out onto a nasty floor, it doesn't work out as planned.  There are also several little loopies that you can use linkadoos, etc. to attach toys with.  There is a little band you can slip a sippy cup in.  And the back pockets are FANTASTIC.  You can use that as a diaper bag!And you really can operate this thing with one hand...the zipper is a little tough so I don't use it, but you just flop this thing in that cart, insert baby, do a few snaps with the straps and you are OFF!It is just a very nice, comfortable "situation" for your baby and for your piece of mind.  And it looks REALLY cool too.  I highly recommend.
+1	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the "Shop'n'Dine") didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.
+1	This cover fits perfectly on Costco shopping carts, covering all surfaces, as well as all supermarket carts. I keep getting stopped by people asking me about it because my baby looks so comfy - it's like a mini sofa! It has tons of features:* Very padded and comfortable, especially for long grocery runs. My baby can nap in it, supported by the pillow, while still buckled in.* Has a wide removable pillow 18" x 6" x 4" that you can insert behind baby to prop them up if they can't sit up well. It's attached by a tether so it stays in the cart.* Secures to the cart with just one hand - you just unzip, plop it into the cart, flip one part over and under the handle, flip the other part over the back, turn the fitted edges over onto the sides of the cart, and attach it with a buckled strap.* Buckled waist belt for baby* Can also be used as a diaper pad. I don't use it for this purpose because the fabric is too nice!* Doubles as a backup diaper bag. Has a large 19"x 11" zippered pocket to put diapers, formula packets, ointment, etc.* Has two smaller 9 1/2" x 4" zippered compartments, for coupons, makeup, wallet, etc.* Two elastic loops to hold formula bottles.* Folded into itself, it zips up all contents neatly to the size of a small duffel bag, (24" x 9" in diameter).* Machine washable cold, machine dry warm. With the exterior's heavy black canvas and all the padding, it doesn't look like something I'd like to wash too frequently. Will have to see how easy this is.* Also comes in pink, at BRU.I've tried the Clean Shopper (almost no padding, smaller, a simple strap goes through the back to secure the baby to the cart) and the Safe N' Easy (cheap quality, looks like a big rain coat/ shower cap, difficult to get baby into, doesn't stay on). They can't compare to this one.
+1	This is a great shopping cart cover.  I love how easy it is to use.  I can hold the baby and arrange this quickly with one hand.  My baby is very happy in it and it gives me peace of mind that she's not touching a germy cart.  Its very well padded and folds up so quickly when done with shopping.
+1	This is so much better than the first gate I bought from Target. (Avoid the Summer 07060C).Pros:- Sturdy- Well made- Super-tall- Two exensions in the box for multiple-wdiths.- It automatically closes.Cons:- Product price- Target's shipping chargeBe sure to see the photos under customer images.
+1	This gate has been fantastic.  We have been using it for 3 years now, and it has been so easy to use.  I admit the opening is too large, but safe enough for everyone to get through.  It's easy to modify to suit your needs.  I recommend these types of gates, which swing open, as I tripped over a tension gate (freestanding style) and broke my leg.  Be safe, not sorry.  This gate is WONDERFUL.
+1	It was very easy to install with the extentions to fit my 47 1/2 inch door way. Didn't take long to get it up and instructions were very clear to understand. Opening the gate can be done with one hand and closes by itself after you let the gate go. It is a very tall gate and I like the good quality grip pads. It comes with adhesive pads or screws to install the mounting cups. I used the adhesive and works great. I got it online at sears for a good price with extentions included. Highly recommend this gate!
+1	What a wonderful find!!!  I was able to install this gate on my own at the top of our staircase within 30 minutes.  It probably could have taken less time but I ALWAYS read the instructions from start to finish and probably spent too much time remeasuring things before installation.  My 1 year old no longer has to remain in his room when upstairs.  He is now free to run up and down the hall and explore the other rooms without us worrying about him taking a tumble down the stairs.I love that the gate swings both ways and was pleased to see that this gate came in the "extra tall" option.  The two extensions that are included are a great perk even though at the present time we are not using them.  However, we plan to continue to use this gate even after babyproofing the stairway is no longer necessary.  As others have already mentioned, it can also be used to keep pets out of specific areas.My only recommendation would be for the company to use metal instead of plastic for the spring latch that locks the gate in place at the top.  We haven't had any problems thus far but it just seems as though plastic would break/snap more quickly over time.
+1	We bought this because our daughter needed something besides the jumperoo to get her moving. She really likes the ability to be able to move around and explore.We liked the activies a lot better on this one because it has more that you can do.The others just don't add up when it comes to play items that are included with the price.Very easy to put together and easy to adjust from one height to the other.Awesome find!
-1	First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.
+1	easy to put together. moves easily and is entertaining. its a great value. my baby was 7mo when we got it she was 28in we've had it almost 2mo now.
-1	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor.  He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work.  The lowest setting is still slightly too high.  Not impressed.  Kinda boring.  Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.
+1	I got this for my 7 month nephew b/c he's getting to a place where he can't walk yet but wants to explore and has strong enough leg motions.  My sister and brother in law already likes this brand, Safety 1st, a lot and owns other things by them.  The price at Amazon was the best.  Sound-making toys can be annoying but I love the music and variety on this walker... reminds me of an ice cream truck... whimsical and pleasant.  The music player piece detaches from the walker for easier cleaning and for tabletop sort-of room when wanted.  Nephew enjoys it; and I can't wait until he fully grasps puttering around all over in it.****Update****So fast forward 3 years and with our own little one, this item has passed back to me from my sister and still great.  The soundmaker is a little faulty now but our baby doesn't care.  He loves the spinning balls more anyways.My only caution is if you are putting it up often and bringing it back out (such as taking it to the in-laws), just make sure everything clicks back in place before each use.
+1	*****UPDATE~1 year of use update is at the bottom******I don't understand why so many people are giving these a negative review(I'll address those in a minute) because my girls LOVE these & play in them EVERY single day, several times a day.We first got these when my girls were 7 months old(see my pics posted above) & both of them were small for their age, my smallest was about 25" & she was able to push heself backward the very 1st time in these. I put tennis shoes on both girls since we were using them outside and that really helped them touch better & give good traction. At first they didn't realize they could move themselves in these, that happened on accident and soon enough both girls realized they could push themselves backward. Learning to go forward took a couple of weeks but once they learned that they were even happier with these. My girls can "drive" super fast in these, they zoom all over in these laughing & squealing with delight. They love to run into things with these, including eachother...like a demolition derby but even when they are speeding & bump into eachother all they do is crack up laughing.Now to address some of the negative reviews that I have read.*there are a lot saying that this was too tall for their baby but I find that hard to believe considering my smallest was about 25"(5th%) when I 1st put her in this. And she is still less than 27" but I've put it on the higest setting(just to test) and she is still able to touch and get around. I think most babies have to 'learn' to use a walker so that may be why people think it is too tall...give them a little time to figure out what this new device is that you've put them in and soon enough they'll figure out what to do.*I've read it was cheaply made. Well my girls have played in these a LOT, they run into eachother, couches, etc. and nothing has broken, fallen off or worn out. These are really sturdy in my opinion. Plus, I don't understand why people are buying one of the cheapest walkers available and then complaining it is cheaply made...Um, buy the much more expensive Chicco...it's like buying a Cavalier & complaining because it isn't as nice as a Volvo.*I've read you can't change the batteries. There are several people on here who have explained exactly how you can change the batteries. My girls used their music/lights a lot in the beginning and 4 months later they are still going strong although they don't turn it on a whole lot anymore, they like driving around more than anything.*I've read the toys aren't that fun. My girls have liked the provided toys from the beginning. Plus I added more toys/teething toys for them which is a very simple solution if your child doesn't enjoy the provided toys.*There is one nutty person who hates all walkers in general, thinks they are unsafe so they would give all walkers a bad review, they just happened to get this one as a gift...and to show a thank you to the person who got it for them they said they hope the person who gave it to them would never have kids...can you say Crazy!!All in all this walker is great for the money. I also love that the toy tray removes completely...if it were like one of the ones that stay attached and open for snacks they would be able to touch the toys and get food all over them. We also use these as seats when we visit people...since they've outgrown their bouncers, we can put them on carpet in these and they have a safe and lovely seat or if on hard surfaces and we don't want them rolling about we just put something like a blanket under them so they can't roll.If you have lots of extra money to spend then buy the Chicco, since it is almost double the cost of this one I'm sure it probably is much nicer, plus I think the colors of the Chiccos are better and to be quite honest, had I not been buying 2 walkers at once, I would have purchased the Chicco myself(I also think the Chicco wheels are probably better, the Chicco wheels look just like the wheels on my girls Wheeley Bugs & they flow over everything perfectly smoothly no matter what-the Safety First wheels don't seem as nice or like they are as smooth but we've had no problems with them). BUT if you like to save money and still want something that works just fine then buy this Safety 1st.*******UPDATE*******So my girls have been using these seats basically everyday, normally several times a day(anywhere from 30 min to over an hour each time) for a year now so I thought I'd give an update.My girls still LOVE them!! The seats are still in perfect condition, well, the lights/sounds no longer work since the batteries are dead but they don't care about that at all. Even if this had never had the lights/sounds they would not have minded. I've washed the seats in the washing machine many, many times and it still looks like new, no holes, no fading, nothing wrong at all, even the thick foam has held its shape perfectly. Nothing has broken, the toys are still in tact. Besides the lights/sounds they are just like they were when we bought them.These are one of the few things that my husband and I feel we definately got our moneys worth & then some. Not only do these seats give my girls independance, they give me & my husband some free time as well. We have a big/long living room and I put up gates so they have to stay in here. Everything is arranged so they can't run into anything dangerous and they can't grab anything they're not supposed to. They LOVE watching cartoons so every morning after breakfast our routine is for them to get in their walkers, I put on their educational cartoons & I can do anything that I need to do: start laundry, computer stuff, etc. They normally relax and lay back with their head resting on the thick foam when they are watching cartoons and they always end up chasing eachother & cracking up laughing. Sometimes I put objects on the couch or chairs that are within their reach w/out them seeing me because they think they've really found some treasure ; )I think the weight limit on this is like 26lbs and I believe my girls will be using these till they reach the limit. They've been walking for months now but still enjoy these tremendously.
+1	I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.
+1	I love this in a cherry finish but the crib I already had was in the natural finish.  I love the changing table up top.  When the baby gets older and it is no longer needed it still looks nice.  I saw some people complain about the cheapness of the drawers.  Children's clothes aren't that heavy and the drawers are spacious.  If you know what you are doing you can add extra support in the drawers but I'm perfectly satisfied.  Nothing missing/Extra parts actually which made me second guess myself at first lol.  For the price and decor you can't beat this deal.
+1	We bought this dresser as well as the tall chest of drawers and the crib back in 2006. My husband assembled all 3 pieces, but didn't seem to have any assembly issues until he got to the crib. That being said- this dresser was a good pick. In fact, the piece is ideal for anyone who doesn't want a changing table sitting around after the child is too old/big for it.I knocked off 1 star b/c the door is now broken. We had a makeshift fix for it that worked for about 6 mos, but 2 mos ago I just gave up and converted it into shelving/book case. It actually looks pretty nice that way.
+1	This dresser/changing table has been amazing!  Most of the cloths for our little girl that are the current size fit in this dresser.  I use the drawers fir cloths.  The shelves I have out baskets in.  The top shelf I fill with diapers.  The bottom has a basket full of miscellaneous baby stuff.  A changing pad, heated wipe holder, and lotions, creams and a small basket fit on the top of the dresser.After our baby outgrows the changing table she will use it as a greaser in her room.Assembly was not too hard.  I took us about two hours.
-1	UPDATE: My horrible experience with this dresser keeps getting worse. Just when I thought my saga was over...... I got my phone bill. The area code for customer service was 604 which we called quite a few times over this issue. Turns out that is located in CANADA so now we owe $15 in long distance charges to a crappy company that never helped us. DO NOT BUY!!!We had bought the matching crib so it made sense to buy this dresser. We should have be warned when part of the crib also arrived broken. It took two hours to put this dresser together, which was not a big deal.... but when we lifted it to put it in place, both sides crumbled away from the screws in the center. We were so disappointed. We called customer service at Stork to see if they would send us another. We got a run around with several rude people answering the phone. They seemed angry that we didn't know the manufacture date, when in fact, that section on the label on the item was left blank! They told us we had to send pictures of the damage so they could determine if it was our fault or their fault. We sent the email several times and it always bounced. We called them and they verified the email address. We tried again a few days later and it still bounced. We called back and they told us to just keep on trying to email them since their email system had been down. At seven months pregnant I dont have the time or energy to keep chasing this. I got in touch with Amazon and they are going to send UPS to come pick it up. They swore we don't have to take it apart so we will see how that goes. Can't wait to get my money back.
+1	I got this from Amazon's warehouse deals so I got $40 off the retail price. With that said The box it arrived in was barely hanging on, but the wood it's self was in another box in the torn up on and wasn't damaged. The woo is pretty good seems some parts are real others are not. But the one that aren't are not really visable. My husband and I put it together in a few hours, we had a few mishaps but nothing to big. Stand really sturdy and looks great from afar. Some of the wood arrived damaged but it isn't anything to big for me. My baby won't care and unless you look up close you can't tell. If you are anal about things looking perfect you may not want this for me it works just great.
-1	This item is absolutely terrible. Quite possibly one of the most frustrating pieces of junk I have ever purchased. It came in a box with numerous pieces of wood and a bag full of 100 different screws and brackets. The instruction manual is something like 25 pages long and is very difficult to understand. In addition, pieces were missing and some of the screws would not fit in their intended place!For the time and effort involved, it would be better to pay the additional money and buy a decent piece of furniture.The assembly of this dresser is a mind game of the worst type: missing pieces, deceptive drawings in instruction manual, etc. I want to take these boards and screws and plummet them at the person who decided it would be a good idea to have a consumer assemble this in such a manner.
+1	I was so excited to receive this item and put together for our upcoming son's arrival! The shipping time was a little more than anticipated, and it was difficult to put together which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five. The cabinet doesn't line up perfectly and there is a gap, but all in all it is very pretty and matches our crib and glider perfectly! Some reviews I read said it isn't a sturdy piece of furniture, but I think it is very much sturdy.
+1	I wanted to give this a rating of 3.5 but thought overall I'm happy with it and it's closer to a 4, so it got the 4/5 stars. We bought this dresser to match our Storkcraft crib and glider. Once assembled, they look BEAUTIFUL as a set in our baby's nursery. However the process to getting the dresser assembled was a frusterating one.. Like others who have posted their feedback, the instructions were terrible!! Had they been a little clearer from the get go, we could've shaved off some valuable time putting it together. Once we figured out the basics of which piece was which, and not really looking at the instructions but figuring out for ourselves where things went, assembly went much smoother. I'm not a particularly handy person,'but was able to figure it out after a few frusterating moments (some pictures dont match the pieces, some holes are not where the pictures say they should be..)Our dresser came with all the needed pieces, and with all the holes drilled for us in the right places (just didnt match the instructions) except for the back where there were no holes and we had to put the nails in ourselves.4 things we did NOT like:1. No holes for back pieces to be put on, you need to drill your own holes into the side edges to get the back piece installed or you will crack the wood. Luckily it's the back and so we didnt care as much what it looked like, ie if the nails were crooked.2. Back pieces didnt fit properly to cover dresser back, so we couldn't nail one piece in place (the one behind the cupboard door part) so now if we open the door and push a little on the shelf inside, it pushes the back board b/c it couldnt be securely installed. Thinking of just staple gunning it in place.3. The drawers are very shallow. The front of the drawer is deceiving because it's much taller,'but the actual drawer is a lot more shallow.4. The drawer runners are short (unlike the pic in the instructions thay show they should go all the way) so you can't open drawers fully. Someoen else mentioned if you want, you can buy longer runners and switch them out.All in all i'm happy with how it looks, and is doing the job we bought it for. Now will see if it stands the test of time.
-1	Really wish we would have just gone to ikea for this price point (i am positive it would have been less annoying) or spent more (you get what you pay for). The assembly process was highly frustrating. My husband and I did it together. We are not especially handy or not handy, just average, but we can certainly follow directions. Too bad these directions were useless. I don't care what condescending reviewers claiming it's easy to assemble have to say, but this took us five very painful hours to put together. The drill holes are misaligned in some cases, which causes functionality issues. After much hair-pulling, we assembled the darn thing. The cabinet door is misaligned thanks to messed up drill holes for the cabinet door hinges. The wood quality is inferior, but the primary drawback is the assembly and the misalignment. You are way better off at ikea, seriously. We have been using it for three months now and we're sticking to it because the drawers turned out okay, and that's its primary use anyway. And yes, look at the dimensions. The drawers are indeed shallow, but it works fine for baby clothes. Still, definitely Not recommended. Go to ikea or spend more.
+1	We had a great experience with this dresser/changing table.It was very easy to put together, looks really good and saves a lot of space in our nursery. No missing parts, no damage what-so-ever and no need to "drill new holes".The drawers are shallow, for an adult/older child, but you're putting baby clothing into them! I can fit about 20 sleep & play PJ sets plus socks in the top drawer alone. Deep drawers just aren't necessary for such small clothing!What I love about the top portion (changing table) is that is has enough room for our changing pad and an organizer to hold all our diapers/lotions/creams.Generally I've found that Stork Craft products are very nice quality and very budget friendly.
+1	Overall I was quite happy with the product and the sales process with Amazon.  One warning is that the items are somewhat darker than I expected from the image.  I originally ordered in the Cherry finish to match some furniture we purchased through Amazon from another company, but it turned out to be much darker than expected so we returned it and got a replacement in Cognac which was approximately the correct color.One thing I appreciated was that the pieces were labeled with numbers - something that helped me get the assembly correct the first time.  The instructions were passable - I really wish manufactures would remember their customers can read and use some text to clarify things but I guess they would then have to print multiple languages for different markets.The dresser was also bigger than I expected, but this was not a problem for us and the dimensions were listed correctly so you can check them before purchasing.Hope this helps!
+1	I didn't think that the dresser was as difficult to assemble as other reviews have made it out to be. Yes, the instructions were primarily pictures and there were a lot of pieces. However, it was easy to follow. I assembled this completely without help from husband (except with getting the door adjusted properly). The only issue I had was with pieces O and N, which appear to be missing but aren't: N just looks different from the picture, and O comes assembled so you have to unscrew the pieces - this is not noted in instructions. Otherwise, pretty simple. The quality is good for the price. People that expected more should have realized that for this price, you will get some pressed wood and will have to self assemble. It's sturdy and looks great in the nursery. I also bought the matching 5 drawer dresser, and am happy with my choices.
+1	I really love this dresser it has the perfect size and it looks cute in our nursery. It can fit a changing pad and you can still have wipes and a few small things next to it. I'm 7 months pregnant and I put it together all by myself. I have to admit it took me a while and you need patience but after 2 1/2 hours it was complete.
-1	I love this changing table's appearance. It is a beautiful looking piece of furniture. Why the low rating? Because it's a piece of junk. First of all, it came with a billion pieces to put together. I even had to put the tracks on the drawers. When I screwed the screws into the frame of the drawers, the particle board (or pressed wood) came apart. The top edges are each separate pieces of wood, so if you try to move the piece of furniture across the floor, the frame easily pulls apart. Did I mention it weighs 50 tons?The drawers themselves are very shallow, but the space in each drawer is much deeper, so you can actually fit more in the drawers than what the drawer allows you to put in.If I did not throw out the box, there would be no question that I would return this item. If I never move it, it may last a while, but I bet after moving it 2-4 times, this will crash and burn!Update: My baby is now 5 months old. The top of this is scratched and the junky coating that is on the wood keeps coming off in chips and gets on my baby.Also, the drawers fall apart sometimes when you open them. What a piece of ****!!!!
+1	My hubby put it together is less than 2 hours. It's a bit difficult to put together but is really solid once it's up!
+1	We used a Stork Craft crib and dresser in our nursery and turned to them again for our son's &#34;big boy&#34; room. These sets are well wrapped and arrive safely, and are relatively easy to put together (maybe not quite as nice as IKEA). We definitely used screwdrivers and drills, not the included allen wrench. :) Overall it looks nice, but I'm disappointed that the finish of the various pieces doesn't match very well. (One drawer front, for example, is noticeably lighter than the others, and a few others had flaws in the finish that were clearly not due to shipping.) The drawers feel a little loose when you open and close them with one hand, as if they're not quite set on the rails well. (Obviously this could be user error when putting it together as well, but we didn't have the same problem with the other Stork Craft dresser.) Finally, the wall-mount (critical for a toddler's room) doesn't appear to be very sturdy and could potentially damage the wall. The high back and wide sides of the dresser top look great but prevent the use of after-market wall mounts that need to attach flush to a side.Still, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture and a great value.
+1	We bought this dresser a year ago for our daughter's nursery. I easily assembled it while my husband was at work. It looks great and the color is beautiful!
-1	My husband is incredibly adept at putting the hardest stuff together, and while it only took him 2 hours to build this dresser, there are a million teeny, tiny parts to use. I would not suggest this item to anyone who sucks at putting together things, like I am.It's a really pretty dresser/change station, and matches our crib but the drawers are not solid wood, they are made of flimsy particle board. Boo on that. The wood itself is also pretty chip as there are dings and scratches in it just from shipping.I wouldn't have been disappointed looking at and maybe buying something else. There was one piece that was broken so we have to call and get that replaced. The changing table part doesn't fit a standard changing pad so that kind of sucks too.PROS- It looks prettyCONS- Cheap material, broken parts, hard to put together, changing table top is small.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
+1	I used this for my coffee bar in the kitchen and it worked out perfect and holds a lot of &#34;junk&#34; in the drawers.
+1	I can't rate on how easy it was to put together as someone got this as a gift for my baby already assembled:)how thoughtful! What I can say is this dresser is pretty good quality for the price. I know there are alot of reviews on other brands of dressers that say its made of flimsy cheap material; this dresser is not the case. Its heavy and stable. I got the cherry color and it is absoutely gorgeous! The only thing I am questionable about on the dresser are the drawers catch. I was told this is a safety feautre, but I am not sure if that is accurate or not. This dresser even comes with some extra doodads so that you can attach your dresser to the wall-great safety feature. Overall I love this dresser and am planning on getting the 5 drawer soon!
+1	I decided to try these even after reading some negative reviews that discussed the fact that these were not leak proof. However, this is one of the features I appreciate about these liners. Thye do not absorb anything and cannot become stained. They merely serve the purpose of making the transfer of dirty cloth diapers from the Mio bucket to the wash cleaner and easier. Of course your bucket will need to be washed because the bags are mesh and will allow drainage into the bucket, but I would rather have the dirty water that drains off my rinsed diapers to dump in the toilet than rolling around in the wash with the diapers I am trying to clean.
-1	We bought this last year for our cloth diapers. i thought it looked like netting but the picture wasn't good. We've been using them for clothes but do NOT use these for diapers!! Anyone who does is insane! They are netting, for sanitations sake, use a wet back for diapers! I would never use this for diapers, it would leak everywhere, they would not hold anything in like wet bags. ugh, disgusting...the very though of using them for diapers makes me sick.
+1	We use these in our cloth diaper pail and they work fine. I'd prefer if they were water tight, but we need to wash out the bucket often regardless. These bags just make the diaper laundry a little bit easier.
+1	I felt like $13 was a little steep for some ink, but I wasn't about to go out looking at stores for a cheaper alternative with a newborn.  The ink is on little sheets, which is nice because you can mold the ink sheets to the baby's feet and hands to get them completely covered.Getting the baby's hands and feet to do what you want is another story, and I highly recommend having 2 patient adults and a sleeping baby.  It took a bunch of wipes to get the ink off my baby, but we were able to get enough off that it didn't stain any clothing.  The rest wore off on its own before the next bath.It comes with 4 ink sheets, and we only even touched 2 for 3 sets of hand or foot prints.  I guess I'll try to keep track of this for a second baby.  It also comes with 4 archival quality paper cards, which is a nice extra even though we only planned to put the prints in the baby book.
-1	for $10 you get two ink pads, 4 sheets, and 1 baby wipe. let me tell you why it's not worth it:1. the ink pads aren't closable. you won't get all the limbs done at once. so if you think you can save the ink pads for later, you'll be disappointed. our ink pads smeared all over the bag that holds them (it's really just a ziplock. when we took them out again, they had smeared all over each other and were a mess to work with.2. there's only one baby wipe! how are you supposed to use this later if you can't do it all at once?3. there's nothing special about the cardstocksave your money.
+1	We just finished my son's prints and they came out as expected.  I posted an image so you can see the results.  We used the same ink pad for all four images.  His hands didn't come out as clearly because he had them balled up into little fists and wouldn't uncurl his fingers.First wipe his hands/feet with the provided wipe.  Then rub them down with some baby lotion.  Press them into the ink pad and slowly roll down on the paper.  To clean them up, first rub on some baby oil and then wipe off with the same wipe they gave you.  It cleaned right up except for a tiny bit around his fingernails.My mom gave him a bottle while I took the prints.  Definitely couldn't have done it on my own without making a mess...
+1	Was really messy but with some coconut oil and baby wipes we were able to remove all the ink.  We did the footprints while baby was very sleepy which I would recommend and they turned out great.  It does take 2 people to get a good print, one to hold the baby and the foot, and another person to press the ink on the foot, and then the foot onto the paper.  We tried to do handprints but baby has a really strong grasp reflex so they didn't turn out as we hoped, but that is no fault of this kit.
+1	While the hospital offered to take footprints of our baby, we were so exhausted of being there that we refused so that we could leave more quickly. Though I didn't regret this decision, I did regret that we didn't have any footprints of our little newborn. So I purchased this product as a way of remedying that. We found it really easy to use, you just put babies feet on the little ink pads and press the feet onto the included thick pieces of cardboard-ish paper. Though you have to be careful that you don't screw things up, since you only get to ink pads and there are 2 feet, we found it pretty easy to do, even with a somewhat squirmy baby. We got four really great prints of both feet and are so happy to have this keepsake.I then scanned in all four sets of prints and now have them digitally to send to grandparents and others. I also plan on making some little photo frames for Christmas for relatives who would appreciate that, and having these digitized will make it easy to do that for everyone. Overall, a great product, easy-to-use, and well worth the price.
+1	It did got very messy, but we put old towel under our baby, any put the baby oil next to us, and clean his little hands and feet right after it was done. Suggestion: print the baby's feet and hands in different days, try feet first, it's easier.
+1	I recommend this product.  I even had the nurse at the hospital do it for me!  Both hands adn feet (since she is the expert, and not me.)  I am able to use it again for my second baby since I did not waste paper on the first trying to attempt it myself.
+1	This was a great project and really easy to use. It cleaned up easily and gave clear prints for our baby book.I ordered one set and there was plenty to do 2 hands and 2 feet.
+1	We got two of those for our baby boy an used them at about 4 months. Worked great, prints turned out very good, the ink can be removed easily with baby oil. The only problem I had was that I could only take the foot prints and so far not his hands - it is really hard to open a babies hand, put ink on it and then press it on a paper without having to spend I guess hours and then change the carpet...All in all a great product, would highly recommend it!
-1	This product is HORRIBLE!  I was looking for a baby safe ink for my infant to make a father's day project with her hand prints. The product indicates it is good for both hands and feet. The ink pad is sticky and messy and the ink does not come off easily.  I was more than perturbed when the ink wasn't coming off of my own hands let alone the child's and horrified she would be putting her hands in her mouth with traces of the ink.
+1	Works well but is very messy.  I preferred the no mess kit over this one.  I tossed it out after one use and ordered the no mess kit.
+1	Have had for almost 2 years and we use it all the time.  Great to have for little ones to keep them out of the sun.
+1	This shade is basically like a piece of spandex with piping in the front to give it the curved shape - it fit my Graco Metrolite stroller with no problem and can see how this would/should fit any stroller. Really easy to put on/off and adjust if needed. If the sun is pointed right at us, I can easily just pull the shade so it goes lower and then just pull it back when the sun is not in our face so my baby can see more! I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they need to get their baby sunglasses for taking walks.
+1	Better sun protection than the compact version (but that is kind of a no-brainer).  I would highly reccomend this product to anyone that uses their stroller outdoors often.  Easy to put on and remove.
+1	I'm a first time mom and was confused when I bought a pretty expensive stroller and the sun always hit my daughter's face.  It got to the point where I actually stopped taking her out for walks because I could see she was getting annoyed with the sun...and who could blame her.  I bought her two hats and even sunglasses, but they all wound up on the ground.  So I did some research and found this and it works great! It doesn't work on my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller, but works very well with the other one.  You just tie it on, shape it, and that's it.  It's flexible too, so when I stuff my strolled in the closet, I just bend the shade back and when I'm ready to use it...it just pops back into place.  This is really wonderful; I am so happy I found it.UPDATE:  Rain, sun, or wind...this thing is still in excellent shape and works great.  Anytime I see a baby in a stroller squinting because of the sun, I tell mom or dad to buy one of these from amazon.  I was literally in traffic one day and I saw a baby that could've really used one of these, so I made a u-turn, rolled my window down and told mom to buy one of these...that's how well it works!
+1	Works great with my Maclaren stroller, brown color matches nicely, and it is a nice size, so it keeps sun out and baby happy, easy to put on, but i do have to take it off to take baby out or fold the stroller. Overall amazing product with great function, glad I bough full size, it covers my baby completely as of right now
+1	We have a Jeep Liberty Limited jogging stroller and while we love the stroller, the canopy leaves a lot to be desired. It was hard for us to take our dauther for walks during the day because the sun was always getting in her face. I started doing some research for some sort of canopy extender and reviewed a lot of the ones on Amazon. I decided on this one because the reviews/details state it is flexible and large enough to do it's job. We purchased it and have had it on our stroller since the day it arrived. It ties on easily and depending on where/how tight you tie it, it can be adjusted even further to cover part or all of the stroller seat. It also folds up with the rest of the canopy when you push it back, so it stays out of the way when you need it to. The only thing is it does catch the wind a lot easier, but other than that, no complaints.
+1	I just recently received a 2013 Maclaren Volo in solid black as a gift. I really love it as a second stroller for public transportation & quick trips. I purchased this organizer in charcoal, the charcoal cup holder by Maclaren, and a black/charcoal Maclaren seat liner.I love this organizer as it doesn't cause the Volo to tip, & the stroller closes with this attached. I use the 2 bottle holders for my son's Pura Kika sippy cups, & they fit inside nicely (without the silicone sleeves). The middle pocket is perfect for my iPhone 5, and the large mesh bag is great for quick access to toys, books, hats, my wristlet, etc.In the bottom basket I store the rain cover & mosquito net, along with an A&A; swaddle blanket, a sweatshirt, & Skip Hop Pronto. I clip my KK water bottle to the handle of the stroller with a Built 24-30oz. bottle sling w/clip, & use the Maclaren cup holder for my iced coffee. I definitely recommend this organizer & the Maclaren cup holder for your stroller. They make the already fabulous Volo that much more convenient!
+1	My first baby is not here yet, but I have a Maclaren Volo and added this to it to give me some storage that is more accessible than the under-the-buggy mesh carrier.  I test drove it in my house, and tried adding some items I figured will be essential.  While it is not gigantic, I anticipate that it will hold what I need to while we do something like stroll the neighborhood or go to the mall.  I like the organizer, and I don't have any complaints about it so far.  Maybe the reality of having a baby in the stroller will change this; but, I am happy with it for now.  The stroller can easily fold all the way down with the organizer still attached, and it looks like it will give me room for essentials without forcing me to dig around under the stroller to get items out of the basket.Interestingly enough, most of the bad reviews for this seem to ding the product for the lack of a cupholder for an adult size beverage.  I don't know if the reviewers who wrote those reviews bothered to actually read the product description.  Had they read the description that is available as of my posting time, then they would have plainly seen that this product is not advertised as something that is designed to hold cups with beverages for adults.  It says it holds bottles!  Clearly, a baby bottle is not the same size and shape as a Big Gulp, a fast food soda cup, or a Starbucks cup.:)  My husband is very handy, and he will probably add a separate cupholder for me before I do much strolling with the Mac.  I scored the organizer for a sweet price when it was on sale.  I read the product description before ordering, so I was not expecting to receive a product to hold a drink from a fast food company or a mall food court restaurant.  If you are looking for a product that does that, then skip this or buy and attach a separate cupholder designed for adult beverages.:)
+1	I use this on my Maclaren Quest Sport.  Pros: you can fold it up with the stroller, and has extra storage for cell phone and maybe a diaper or two and travel wipes container.  Cons: didn't fit Avent bottles or larger sippy cups (we use Tommee Tippee), cup holders only fit pint sized waterbottles & other plastic bottles (like 20 oz soda for example)- and a definite NO to those paper take out cups(we learned the hard way) I bought a cheap cupholder seperately (Munchkin).  Overall, it is worth buying to save yourself some aggravation with the hard-to-access basket on the Maclaren stroller when seat is reclined.
-1	I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller).  At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders.  The only function that I actually used was the cup holders, which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would. While I used this bag, it caused more frustration than anything.  It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it.  The final straw came 6 months after using it.  We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back.  As a last attempt, I took the bag off, and miracle of miracles!  The stroller folds up fine!  In my opinion, don't waste your money, just buy a standard cup holder!
+1	Must have. It has space for bottles (standard neck), a pouch for my phone, space to throw in pacifiers and what nots.
+1	My little boy is now 6 months old and we use this baby every single day!!!!  I don't know how we would get through middle of the night diaper changes or dressing after bathtime without this!  Baby started to notice this around 4 weeks old and there has been no going back!  This is definitely the best out there.  He loves the lion and the pictures of the animals on the side.  The lion's feet have rattles so that all we really have to do when he is fussing during a diaper change, etc. is bat at his legs to get baby's attention.  What a lifesaver!!!  We could not be happier with this thing.  It is literally worth every penny.  It is on the of the few items that you really do need.
+1	I don't know why they call this a "mobile" since it has no moving parts, no motion or sound, it just hangs there.  That being said, this is the best toy I've gotten for my 10-week-old son so far.  I don't know why he loves it so much, but now the changing table is his absolute favorite place to be.  He smiles, laughs, and flails his arms and legs in excitement any time we get near it, and would probably stare at it laughing and cooing for hours if I let him hang out on the changing table that long.  Its been a real godsend for distracting him from his hunger screeching at 6am while I'm trying to get his diaper changed first!
+1	We have had this mirror for both of our girls, and they both loved it!  It keeps them entertained while you're changing them, and two of the lion's paws rattle, which my girls enjoy grabbing and kicking.
+1	This held up great to two babiesand a lot of guest babiesand has been handed over to another expecting motherWashed wellstill looked goodthe music might drive you bonkers but....well that happens when you have a new baby and no sleep.BUT... if your baby is a rolling little thing they can knock it down if you don't have it standing up right
+1	Great! It has lights and bright colors which my daughter loves. You can also choose the mode so you can have it play for 20 minutes straight for younger babies or the playing one where the baby has to touch the toys and it will play music. Great music and nature sounds. My daughter gets to play and have great fun while mommy gets to get things done
+1	Everywhere you turn, there is some sort of stimulation on this gym. My daughter (2 1/2 months) loves it! I especially like that one of the settings requires touch to start the music. She loves the mirror and the lights above.
+1	This mat was a no brainer for me after getting theFisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swingand seeing how wonderful the colors and brightness of the product are.  No, it is not meant for travelling and the mat is perfectly thick enough, even on my hardwood floors.The only issues I had with it was the amount of time spent trying to figure out how to get the butterflies to move (they don't) and that there are no extra rings to add length (a little short for a 3 month old to view AND grab at the same time) or to attach more of your own toys.  But those are insignificant and not problems compared to how many hours she has played with it and believe it or not, her activity on the playmat has tired her out so that she finally slept through the night!  That in it and of itself makes this worth so much more than I paid for it, as far as I am concerned.No matter which one you end up choosing, be sure to get a playmat.  It was incredible how quickly she has developed since we bought ours a week ago.  She "talks" so much more now, coos, smiles, laughs and just makes crazy noises and loves kicking the elephant rattle and looking at herself in the mirror.  Also, I posted some customer images for a better idea.  Enjoy! :D
+1	My 3 month old baby loves this playmat!  He lays under it several times a day and is always happy to hang out in the rainforest :)  He will stare at those "butterfly girls" hanging from the center and just smile and coo at them.  He also likes the monkey and the elephant rattle. The mirror is great, too, although I agree with another review that said it's at an awkward angle and needs held for the baby to see in it well, although my baby will look at other reflections in it and even grab at it to turn it himself. The lower hanging toys are at a perfect height for him to bat at while laying on his back.  When on his belly, he likes to look at the scene on the mat, too.  The music is catchy (everyone at my house can sing it LOL) and I appreciate the 2 levels of volume.  The rainforest sounds are nice for a more quiet, soothing playtime.  I like that there are multiple hanging hooks all around so you can move toys around and add your own additions.  The bottom mat can go in the washing machine and dryer and comes out great.  This is a favorite spot for my baby and has given him hours of enjoyment (as well as 15 minute windows of time for mom to fold laundry, etc. while he plays contentedly! :)
+1	This has been the only one of her "toys" that she has loved pretty much from the get go... by the time she was about 4 weeks she would last about a half hour on it, looking at the lights and listening to the music. She went from accidentally batting the animals to now, at 5 months, playing with them and laughing until she eventually falls asleep all tuckered out :) I am going to buy a second one for her to have at her babysitter's house. Absolutely LOVE this!!
+1	GAME CHANGER!!My 7 week old LOVES this! I mean- LOVES it. It provides all the stimulation she needs and keeps her endlessly entertained. Because she's so young we have not used the music or lights yet, but we will transition into those features as she matures. It is unbelievable how much she enjoys all there is to look at. It also buys mom and dad precious time!Quality fabrics, smart patterns/design, effortless to assemble. Other gyms pale in comparison.As you review which gym is right for your baby, note the dimensions. Some are quite small, making its longevity limited. This gym is the perfect size for baby to grow with.
+1	My son has loved all the colors of this play gym since he was a couple weeks old. He loves the lights and the rattles. I don't like that it plays the same song over and over and over again. I wish there was some variety as my son LOVES music. I also don't like that the butterfly mobile doesn't move on its own. I have to sit and move it around and after a while my arm gets tired, which makes my son mad because he likes them to move. Other than those 2 small things this is a great play gym. My son LOVES to be on it!
-1	I bought this mat originally because of all the great reviews. However, my duaghter did not care for it as much ...and the arches easily fell down. I decided to buy the Tiny Love Mat and that was a success. Every baby is different and sometimes you just do not know what your little one will end up liking.I do have the rainforest jumperoo which she REAllY loves ...the bouncer she did not care for though.
+1	This is an awesome baby gym. It has many toys on it and the lights on top are great. My daughter loved being in hers. It had a lot to do and would keep her busy for a while. I also like that it is sturdy on top so it is not flimsy. My friend had a different more trendy/expensive one and this was a lot better than hers. This was so helpful and useful for my little girl. It is well worth the money.
+1	This activity gym has a lot of activity for an infant.  The individual toys are easy to take on and off.  The music and lights not to loud or bright.
+1	My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and she already loves this.  I like all of the different textures and sounds from the mat and toys- the leaf on the bottom makes crinkly sounds, there are beads in a roller, and the mat itself has silky ribbon bows and other textures.  My only complaint is that the two butterflies underneath the sound box don't spin on their own.  But mostly she just likes looking at them right now, so it isn't a problem.  It was easy to put together, and we've used it for a few minutes a day for a few weeks and the batteries are still going strong.  I also like the music (it isn't tinny sounding like some) and the forest sounds make my daughter's eyes go big and round.  I received this as a gift and in addition to her bouncer, this is her favorite item.
+1	My son loves this gym! The lights and music keep his attention and the mat is super soft. He seems to really like the colors and the toys. It folds in half so I can store it when he isn't using it!
+1	I just received the item, have not opened, but it looks great good quality and very pretty, I like it
+1	This is a wonderful activity gym.  It keeps my little guy entertained for stretches of time.  However, the music will stop playing after maybe 15 seconds, and he gets frustrated.  You need to hit the gym to get it going again.  There is even a suggestion on the directions that if it stops working to open the battery pack and close it again.  This seems to be an issue that Fisher-Price is aware of.  For as many units that they sell, I really think they should have resolved the issue rather than simply suggesting that parents shake the battery pack.
+1	I have this and the Tiny Love Lights and Music. I prefer this one much more. The toys hang taller, so that they're not right in my baby's face, but she can still reach them. I also think the toys are more interactive compared to the Tiny Love, and made better. Visually this one looks much nicer, especially the mat. The mat is padded but you probably want to put it on a soft surface like a carpet or bed (obv watching your baby at all times). The rainforest sounds are nice. The music could be a little better. I like the lights at the top, but my baby doesn't seem to interested. The mat has interactive qualities as well, crinkles and ribbons and such. The only thing I didn't like was that the butterfly mobile doesn't spin on it's own. Kind of pointless. If I had to do it over again, I would just buy this one. Amazon has the best price.
+1	My son has loved this from the time he was a couple weeks old.  It has lots of things to play with and he loves the lights and music.  I like how you can set it to where he has to hit a hanging toy to make the music and lights go on. It is also a really great price, way cheaper than what is in the stores.
+1	my baby loved it and it got her interacting more than most kids her agw
+1	This mat is very nice and easy to assemble. It is of a fair size which will accommodate your baby with space to spare. It has a set of 4 color lights on top, shining and catching the attention of your baby. It also has music with 2 volume settings. The batteries are installed on the big orange giraffe, and it is hard to get to them, which is exactly what you want for the safety of your baby. The mat has many "attractions" for your baby, from monkeys hanging from the tail to toucans to zebras. It is very well made. My baby boy is not 3 months yet and he just lays there watching everything and trying to grab all! :-) I would highly recommend this mat, it helps your baby with his/her motor skills.
+1	This is the third activity center that I tried before I fell in love. The Baby Einstein and the Boppy one both failed before this beauty. This is the perfect size, great colors, great toys, great mobility, great lighting/music! Overall a great, great product that my 10 month old still loves. The monkey that came with this is still one of my baby's favorite toys. Comes with a mirror, rattle, monkey and much more...Great toy!
+1	Our son loves this!!  He really started liking it around 2 months, with the lights at the top.  He would just keep looking at them, and, as he's gotten older, he continues to love it.  It was great for when he was first learning to reach - there's a little monkey who's tail curves around a small loop, and, that's when I noticed he was learning to reach for things - he was determined to get the monkey!  Now, and 5 1/2 months, he pulls down the monkey within the first minute of setting him under, but, he still loves it, although is starting to outgrow it a bit, as he now rolls over on his belly, and ends up kicking at the long bars that hold it together, but, even given that, it still holds up amazingly well.
+1	This is such a fun gym.  It kept my son entertained for quite some time even before he could roll over.  It is well made and well designed.  It took very little time to put together and the batteries are easy to replace. The music is similar to that on the Rainforest high chair and so are the characters.  You can lie the baby diagonally on the mat so that his feet can kick or push the side pole and activate the music and lights. It also has a setting where the music and lights  run without stopping for around 20 mins, and it is not horrendously irritating.  There are two volume settings too.  Each of the toys is a different activity and have kept my son busy for ages.  Now he is spending more time on his front they detach from the gym and attach to the floor mat.  A very good value for money product.
+1	I love this activity mat. It has quite a few toys and empty hooks to put your own. The music is very nice and not annoying. I wish that the butterflies didn't get in the way of the flashing lights at the top though. My guy has reflux so I usually put him on the boppy looking up. If he's been awake (and digesting) long enough we do tummy time here too.
+1	I was initially concerned about spending so much on a play mat, but it is worth every penny. My 3-month-old daughter loves the rain forest gym and stays absolutely entranced with the brilliant colors, flashing lights and butterflies. This has also helped encourage tummy-time, which she hadn't previously been too keen on. I like the extra loops on varying levels that allow me to attach more of her toys. The only thing that would improve this product would be to have the butterflies spin on their own.
+1	I like the things this gym has to offer but my baby hasn't gotten into it yet.  The music can be a little too loud even with the volume control (2-settings).  I love the rain forest sounds, which is very soothing.
-1	Me and my 3 babies have tried out 3 playmats (Precious Planet and Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym) and this is the least favorite.I don't like it because quite honestly, it's ugly.  Certainly not something I liked having in my living room.  We actually have some of the other Rainforest products and they are much more attractive.More importantly, the bars are flimsy and don't stay in place.  After only a few minutes the bars lean to one side or the other (despite being held together at the top) and the entire set-up looks like a very large person sat on it.I thought this would be a great mat because there are lights at the top where the bars connect. My son seemed to like this and the music, but I couldn't stand having to fix the bars every ten minutes.Most of the toys that come along with this seem cheap and uninteresting to my babies. (As opposed to the Precious Planet Playmat, which came with higher-quality toys). I ended up tossing them and using other toys to hang.We had this in our house for barely a month before I gave it away. We'll stick with the Precious Planet Playmat.
+1	We borrowed this from a friend and it's just so darn cute. My daughter loves it. The music is charming. It lights up with different colors. It's soft and cushy to lay on. Bright and colorful. Everything you could ask for in a floor play gym.
+1	We got this as a shower gift, along with several other play gyms.  After looking closely at all of them, we decided to keep this one and returned the others.  I'm glad we did.  This one is perfect.  We already use it for "tummy time."  The mat is soft and when he spits up, it wipes off easily.  I like the mix of soft and plastic toys attached and the fact that they all come off easily since my little guy cant reach them yet.  After tummy time we roll him over and he loves to stare at the lights and butterflies.
+1	My son grew up with this gym. I never put on the music or lights but just had him under the hanging dolls. He loves pulling it and biting it. He will sometimes yank it so hard that the dolls come of the hanger. Overall it keeps him entertain for a while but it's good to have in the house so he won't be staring up at the ceiling when he's laying on his back.
+1	I received this as a gift for my first son and it worked great! There is a lot for baby to play with and look at. Pad underneath holds up well in the wash and the music is nice. I just had another son three years later and brought this out again. Looks and works like new. You can't go wrong with this.
+1	I can't say enough about this play matt; it's great quality. We got ours already used three years ago, my son loved it, now my daughter; it's been through 3 or 4 kids and it still looks like new. The toys are engaging and moveable the lights and butterflys are what makes it so great for younger babies and I love that it has a low setting for volume and 'nature sounds' for when you cant take anymore toy music and the shake option to save battery life.
+1	We have had so much fun with this toy! The first time I set it up and put my son under all the fun toys and music and lights, his face lit up and his smiles were HUGE! It has been amazing!
+1	My son used this gym pretty much since he was born until he was 9 months old and could crawl and stand! HE LOVED IT. I cannot stress enough how much of a lifesaver this thing was. He LOVED everything on it, especially the monkey. I personally found that it had plenty of toy loops to add your own, and all of them were filled. He would spend up to an hour even as a young baby just playing or napping on this gym. He loved the little extras on the floor of the gym, like the lions tail that sticks out, and the leaf that crinkles. He also REALLY loved the lights at the top of the gym, especially on the setting where they were synced with the music.I didn't have any problems with the mirror falling out (sounds like that one was faulty...) but I do agree that the way the mirror hangs does not face the baby. The EXTREMELY EASY solution to this problem was just to add one of those plastic toy links that your probably already have a million of. Problem solved. Also loved that it was super easy to clean. Even when my son was older and could sit, crawl, and pull to standing, he would pull up on the gym and stand there playing with the toys hanging down, or crawl and sit under the toys. I was surprised that we got such extended use out of this (we finally put it away sometime after he turned 9 months to make room for other toys)
+1	My son loves this. He enjoys watching the colorful lights flash on the top. The soothing jungle sounds are nice too. It is large but does fold flat for storage. The hanging toys are colorful and eye catching. I was disappointed that the two butterflies that hang from the center do not turn by themselves. I originally thought they would be like a mobile and would turn automatically. Instead they just sort of hang there.The batteries in the unit are installed within the giraffe's bottom using two screws (as with most children's toys). I wish it used AA's or even D size batteries as C's are not something we usually keep on hand in our house. The battery life is pretty long though.
+1	This is something we got our son for Christmas and he sits on it every day since.  He adores it and putting a little blanket over it and laying underneath it with him with the lights on and the bug sounds he has a lot of fun.  We love this.
+1	Bought this for my son. So far he hasn't used it much, but thats because he is still quite young. But I am sure once he is a bit older he will love it. Only issue I have is the mat isn't as big as I thought it would be. But besides that its colorful, pretty interactive and I can see getting a lot of use out of it.
+1	My 2 month old son loves this play mat. He started following the light pattern about 2 weeks ago and is now paying attention to the toys dangling down from the cross bars. The mirror that comes with this has been so handy as well, I didn't have to go out and buy one for him.
+1	I've been told the activity mat is a must, and I can't imagine this mat is going to be anything other than fun for our new kiddo. It was given as a gift, but even if it hadn't been, I probably would have wanted to get it anyways.
+1	Love this playmat! We also have the baby einstein ocean playmat and they are both great... We love the sounds and effects on this playmat and our son has loved it since day one (about 3-4 months old)..Now that he can crawl he will lay on it for a few minutes and chew on toys, but we like to leave the music and lights on for him while he crawls around and plays.. He can flip it over now, and he thinks that it is funny, but it is sturdy and he never could flip it when he was younger..
+1	Our Daughter loves it!  We've pretty much been using this since she came home from the hospital.  She liked looking at the lights when she was a newborn.  Now that she's a little older and more aware, she is digging on staring at herself in the mirror and batting at the toucan.  I like that I can change up the toys to make it "fresh" for her so she doesn't get bored with it.  This is surely a hit in our house!
+1	My little 2 1/2 month grandson was delighted with this! The blinking lights, different sounds kept him amused. I would recommend this to anyone.  Price & Quality were exceptional through Amazon!
+1	I bought this playmat for my second son.  I paid about $70 for mine, at the time, that was a good deal.  It was still a little more than I wanted to spend.  However, I am glad I bought it, my son loved it and from the time he was a couple of weeks old until last week (he is now 7 months old and getting ready to crawl)  he used that mat several times every day!  The music has volume control - which I love, and an option to stop playing until activated by the baby moving the poles.  I never had to replace the batteries.SO why the four stars?  Well, the price is a little steep, even a drop to $55 would be more appropriate.  Also, one of the poles would come out.  Now, I do have a 2 year old, and he also liked  to  "play" with the mat, so it is possible that our mat got a little rougher play than most, but it was still something we had to keep an eye on.
+1	My three month old loves this gym. She isn't very good at entertaining herself yet, but she kicks and plays happily in this gym. The toys are easy to move around and keep her attention so mom can get a thing or two done around the house!The music is much less annoying than many other toys & the nature sounds actually sound pretty nice. It also is great for tummy time. This product could replace a tummy time mat, a bouncer seat & many other toys.I'd recommend spending the extra money to get this over a less expensive gym.
-1	We got this as a gift for our 6-week old twins and they were mostly indifferent to it, ignoring the toys and lights.They seemed to enjoy the music but there isn't much of it.  Just a short loop that keeps repeating.  I don't think the girls minded much but it annoyed the adults.  The lullabies on my mp3 player impressed them a lot more.Perhaps they'll care more for it in a month or two but for now it's a bust.
+1	This has held up to two kids over three years time, and it works just fine.  The kids loved playing in it. Lots of lights and toys to distract them.  Over time, I've added some more toys to it to get some more playtime so I have a few moments to myself to have some coffee!
+1	We got this as a gift for our baby at the shower.  It was one of the first things we put out for her, and she took to it quite quickly.  She like the sounds it makes, there is a little crinkly leaf in one of the corners, across from the giraffe that really keeps her attention.  The sounds on it are nice, you can set it for music, jungle sounds, or music only when the actvity center is played with(meaning the child is activly playing in the gym.  Good floor gy, would reccomend it to anyone who wants something to put thier child in to keep them interested for a few minutes, eve at a early age.
+1	I got this for my daughter who loves it, it is very easy to assemble. My baby loves to be inside this. This is a good buy for the babies
+1	On first introduction, my son at 2.5mos old wasn't particularly interested. Tummy time especially was not happening. He enjoyed gazing and eventually reaching for objects as he got older. Inevitably he'd turn himself over and become fussy. At 5 mos now he finally enjoys looking and grasping at objects on the mat. He soaks it of course with drool and so far I've had no problem throwing it in the wash. I don't blame the mat when he didn't enjoy it, certain interests take time to develop.  Oddly my dog ignores the attached toys as baby only with the exception of the monkey. We gave up on the monkey after finding it downstairs a few times.I do have one complaint - the music and lights do not always work. If I use the first setting it stops playing after maybe 30 seconds and only restarts briefly if you nudge the poles. The second setting doesn't generally have this problem. Baby doesn't necessarily seem to notice but it bugs me.
+1	By far, this is our favorite baby gift! Our little one is 5 months old and she has used this toy several times a day everyday for the last 4 months. It keeps her smiling. I love the bright colors and lights. The music isn't annoying for parents. When  my baby was a month old this kept her entertained while I drank my coffee, priceless! I also love the other rainforest items  by Fisher-Price. Baby loves them all.
+1	This is the best gym out there!  It has plenty for them to play with, but it also has the several modes for the lights and sounds.  We looked at them all and decided this was the best...and best for the money!
+1	My parents got this for my 7 week old son for Christmas and he just loves it. We use the mat for tummy time and I can pull the toys off the hooks to entice him to turn and lift his head up, or I can lay him down on his back and he will happily lay there watching the lights and looking up at the dangling toys. He loves music so he will coo and babble when he listens to the music.
+1	Baby loves this and has used it every single day since birth till now (hes 8 months)
+1	We got this when our baby's vision improved enough to see farther (~2 months). We chose it from the many other baby gyms because looked very colorful and had lots of things going on.The toys are great, she loves them all. The only one we have trouble with is the parrot on the perch as she's conked herself a couple of times in the face with it while playing with it, it's a little hard and heavy.All choking problems have been taken care of, so no worries there.The mirror isn't really big enough for her to see herself while on her tummy so I actually put it around the butterfly holders so that she can see herself while looking up on her back, works better this way.The butterflies don't move on their own, but I knew they wouldn't from the item description. Once they can reach high enough, they can move them on their own.The music is great, enough variation to not drive you nuts. Between 2 songs, a little intermission plays which is really calming. There is a setting to only let music play when the gyroscope moves from the gym being played with or you can set it on continuous playing, which lasts for about 30 minutes.My favorite, or rather my baby's favorite, are the lights. They really help calm her down at night for bed, we just have her lay on the mat in the dark and have the lights going on, she plays for a bit then just stares at the lights.The gym is sturdy even on carpet. I think a lot of people don't realize that the two arms snap in place so that it actually can't fall down. It does not permanently attach so it makes it easy to pack it up and go.Overall, I'm glad we got this. Now that she is rolling over and loves trying to grab at the images on the mat. It also has hooks on the sides of the mat so you can put the toys there for tummy time. Great play mat!
+1	My daughter adored her gym until she was about 6 months old and she started sitting. It's perfect for tummy time so baby's little face isn't mashing into the carpet. My daughter LOVED the giraffe - she would stare at it and grin and jabber to it non stop. It was so neat watching her go from just lying there to reaching up and batting her toys around. The monkey falls down after awhile but you can knot his tale to keep him up there. My daughter like to pull him down though. My only complaint is that it doesn't store well. Once you set it up, it's really easiest to just leave it up until you're ready to pack it up for the next baby or yard sale. It's not difficult to take down and put back up - just not convenient if you need to do it often, which we didn't.
+1	My baby boy just spend 20 minutos as much. I would like the music were loud but instead ins sounds too low. the hanging toys are nice and cute but is not the preferred toy of my baby.
+1	They baby loved thi Gym. It is made very well and is sturdy. Can handle everything a baby can do to it.
+1	This play gym has survived through two children and looks just as great today as it did when we bought it. We wash the mat and the plush toys often. The items are easy to clean. The butterflies do not spin automatically like I kind of assumed they might, but they are fun for the kids none-the-less. Colorful with great sounds and great detachable toys.
+1	I didn't realize how much my son (now 5 months) would enjoy this gym! He has loved looking up at the lights and the mirror since about 4-5 weeks old. As he has grown, he's enjoyed playing with all the hanging toys. I've added other toys using links and have also found the gym useful for tummy time.There is a soft and a loud setting for the music (which really isn't too obnoxious), but I especially like that you can set the &#34;nature sounds&#34; to soft, and the lights will still go without having to listen to music if you don't want to. I would definitely recommend this item for new babies!
+1	My son got A LOT of use out of this play mat. He used it for about 6 months or so...just till he could start scooching off the mat to check out other things. What I really liked about this is the removable toys. I took them off and attached them to his stroller and walker, so while he's now too old for the mat, he's still getting use of the little hanging toy that come with it!My only complaint is this doesn't fold up, so it does take up a bit of room when not in use. I also had a Baby Einstein play mat, but my son didn't enjoy it as much as he did this one...however...the Baby Einstein mat folded in half, so storing it out of the way was nice. Overall, I absolutely recommend this mat! My boy just loved it, so it was money very well spent!
-1	Our 3 month old found the gym a bit too overwhelming. He just did not like the gym at all. But he did enjoy playing with each of the toys individually when detached from the gym. Also sometimes babies hold up the rattle/toy and lets it drop...it may fall on their face and hurt them.
+1	At six weeks, our son started kicking more and wanting a little independence. We pulled out the rainforest that was a gift from an aunt and found that he loved it. He can spend an hour in the rainforest just as happy as he can be. He only kicked the toys until he was ten weeks and then started using his hands. It was necessary to move the toys around to make them accessible to him. He now at fourteen weeks has both hands and both feet hitting something at the same time. It is entertaining to watch and good exercise for him. We did add a few toys since all of the loops weren't used, which was a nice option. We also felt that the music and lights were too much for him until he was ten weeks old. It truly entertains him, and I highly recommend it.
+1	Twice a day for 15 min since our son was two months old. He is now 6 months and still enjoys it. He first rolled over in this jungle gym. at different stage of his development he is interested in different things, rattles first and butterfly then the leaf and he loves the little zebra tail he picks at it and chew on it all the time, great for improving motor control.
+1	I don't have anything to compare this activity gym to, but overall I am satisfied with this purchase. My son is 4 months old now. When he was a little younger he enjoyed watching the lights and listening to the melodies. Now he is mostly interested in grabbing at the dangling toys. He doesn't engage with much of the other features yet. He doesn't use it for very long. I think because he doesn't really like being on his back and also he gets frustrated because he wants to pull the toys down to chew on them. However, it is good when I want to get something done like the dishes or washing my hands after a diaper change.The thing I don't like about his gym is that the battery is in the giraffe which connects to the lights and sounds on top, so if you move it around a lot it messes with the connection.
+1	Excellent gym mat for the little one! Lots of extra items to change around. Colorful, musical, and easy to setup.The 2 downfalls I've encountered are (1) it requires 3 "C" batteries (they are located under the giraffe) and (2) the music doesn't have an option to continually stay on until you turn it off. Unfortunately, with children under 3 months of age, they don't have the ability to touch anything yet to keep the machine music playing. Consequently, someone has to hit the top object to get the music to stay on and coincide with the lights.However, the mat is great and very useful!
+1	Both of my kids adored this play gym. Out of all of them I've seen this is by far the best well made one. The colors, music, and toys kept my kids entertained for a very long time.
+1	I have used this play mat with both of my kids. My son LOVED it and my daughter loves it too. I bought another play mat but we both weren't satisfied so i dug this one out of the basement. Three yrs later and it still works the same.
+1	I never imagined how much fun Baby could have in a play mat. Our son used this for months, it was fun to watch him grow in it. He used to love laying on his back looking at everything, then seeing the pictures on the bottom. As he grew, he realized how the sound could be turned on by hitting the toys. He learned to roll over then crawl playing in this mat. He just never grew tired of it. It was interesting to him until he simply out grew it!
+1	I got this because of all the positive reviews on Amazon. The music is great, not annoying at all. Baby really loves the mirror and all the different toys that hang. I've caught him chewing on the giraffe's tail on occasion, too, which is pretty entertaining. Now that he can sit up, he likes to sit and reach for the butterflies, which is really cute, too. He's had this since 4 1/2 months and really enjoyed it then and still does now.
+1	I used same play gym for my daughter 4 years ago. it worked great than. now with my son, my daughter wanted to get this playgym only. she didn like anything else she saw.
+1	This is good with music and light.. most of the other gyms don`t have light..My Son is enjoying being in the playmat. It works well in the tummy time too..Believe your angel will start exploring about rainforest...
+1	My baby has loved this from the time she was about 6 six weeks and would lie underneath it and look at the toys and lights and listen to the music, to now when she is 6 months and likes to roll around under it, sit on the side and play with the giraffe and lie on her stomach and study the patterns. For me it has given me the opportunity to put her down, knowing she will be happy for around twenty minutes, and I'll have the chance to get something done. However, shop around. The price for this toy varies a lot!
+1	I registered for this on a whim because it looked cute.  It keeps our baby so happy!  She doesn't love her swing and many other toys but this keeps her entertained for a long time.  She likes to dance to the music and it makes her giggle.  The hanging toys are wonderful.  She likes to "talk" to the hanging monkey for extended periods of time.  It may not look like much but this activity gym can be your best friend.  We have bought the jumperoo and the car mirror just so she can have other activities with her familiar jungle animal friends.
+1	Our son loves this! The toys can unhook and move to different hooks, including a few on the mat. And the mat itself has great details to play with. Highly recommend!!
+1	This mat provided my son with plenty of stimulation - blinking lights, swinging animals, and music.  This is where he perfected his motor skills.  All the cons are VERY minor and it's worth every penny spent.
+1	This is such a cute playmat. My little guy likes it. It provides music, lights, and toys......plenty of activity to keep him busy for a little while!
+1	I love all the toys on this one and the different music options. My twin girls love it too and can be entertained by it for hours. It has plenty of room for both girls and great bright colors. I'm really glad I purchased it has comeand would buy it again as a gift.
+1	We bought this gym for our 2 month old son and he absolutely loves "playing in the jungle!"  Between the flashing lights, the music and the hanging toys, he's got plenty to keep him busy.  Although it seems early, I'm pretty sure he's already figured out which toy rattles when it's hit and he bonks it to hear the noise!  He "dances" and coos and looks at everything.  I'm just so happy with this purchase.  It was $30 cheaper on Amazon than the local stores too!
+1	Both my babies love activity play mats and this one offers a lot to play with, especially since you can hang other toys on the extra rings. But this one is exceptionally expensive, especially if you're a frugal mom. There are some nice models for half the price.The one does have a 20 minute music timer to help keep your babe entertained which is a very nice feature. The mirror is also great for tummy time.If you're looking for a complete list of things to add to your registry, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com.

+1	Purchased when my 4 month old seemed to be getting bored with her sea gym. She was excited and engaged from the moment we put her down with this. Fairly easy to assemble and can be kept clean easily. Very pleased with this purchase!
-1	My 2-month old twins seemed to really enjoy this playmat.  They were able to hang out for a full 20-30 minutes and be entertained until the music/light part stopped working.  I'm really annoyed that I need to buy a new one now.  I will definitely try a different brand.
+1	This play gym SAVED us! Our daughter is now 9 months old and still plays with this. All the toys that come with it are great for the little one to play with on her saucer, and in her stroller.We love that the music turns itself off after 20 minutes.Easy to clean, good battery life. Very happy
+1	I received this gym at my baby shower, so my baby (who is 7 months old now) has been playing with it for awhile now. He really likes it and it has been something he has played with in a lot of different ways as he has developed. He started out laying on his back and just watching the lights. It was also good for tummy time (which he tended to hate in general) because it gave him something to look at as he laid on his stomach. Now, he sits up and plays with the toys that hang from the gym. He also uses the bars to support himself as he practices standing up (with me sitting right behind him in case he decides to let go). The one negative about it is that the music is really fast, it's the typical cute baby songs (Animal Fair, Pop Goes the Weasel, etc.) but at warp speed, which is a little weird. Other than that, I love it and so does my baby!
+1	My baby loves this gym.. The colors are bright to draw baby's attention. Also the design on the mat is great with so many different animals on it and some tiny tags for the baby to pull. The music and lights are nice. It is really a nice play mat for babies. My son enjoys it a lot. I use it for play time and also tummy time. He smiles every time I put him on the mat and show him all the animals and lights.
+1	My daughter started using this gym when she was just over 2 months old.  She would only play for about 5-10 minutes at a time she would mostly look at everything and hit things by accident.  I always placed her feet on the crackly leaf.  I added a few different toys like jacques the peacock and celest - sun/moon toy with a teething star that hung almost to the bottom, and her zebra.  At 3 months she got a lot more use out of it like 20 minutes or more a day she could grab onto the teething star and the zebra and spin the parrot.  she started shifting herself around to get to different toys. By 4 months she was would stay and play for an hour or more... and she started rolling over - i think it had to do with all the kicking and arm swinging from playing in the gym it just really helped develop her muscles.  She is now 7 months old and does not play in it so much (I keep it set up in the living room so she can crawl to it and play  when she wants) just yesterday I found her sitting up in there now playing with the butterflies!
+1	This was given to us as a gift and my child has warmed up to it as she's getting older. The music is not annoying and the lights keep her attention for a few minutes when she's on her back. When the baby kicks the giraffe, the songs come on. Good for tummy-time, too. The mat is very colorful and soft. Washes easily. It was simple to assemble and lightweight to transport. I'd recommend it.
+1	baby like it a lot. she like to watch herself in the mirror, and also like the monkey with long tail.
+1	This is by far the most needed baby product for moms that need a good 15 mins to either eat, do some chores, or even take a shower (never leave the baby unsupervised though....yes that means place it in a safe spot you can see while in the bathroom). The mat is super cute and colorful and the toys are very entertaining for the little one. I watch him as he lays on the mat and tries to kick and grab different hanging toys. The music/light feature is great too. My baby just figured out that he controls the music (it makes noises every time he successfully grabs any of the hanging toys) and he is smitten! This gym is definitely a lifesaver for both the baby to enjoy and learn as well as stay entertained during tummy time and for the parents that need a break from the baby. This product is a must!
+1	My baby loves it. It's excellent for playing and tummy time.
+1	Very good toy. first time my baby was in it, immediately started playing with it and loved to playing with the monkey.
+1	My 2 year 7 month old granddaughter used this when she was an infant and now her four month old brother is using it.  This product has been very enjoyable for each of them. Not only is it colorful, but also is good for practicing "tummy time" to help your child hold up their head.This is very easy to put together and take apart. This product has traveled on lots of family vacations. After nearly three years of use it is still looks like new and has held up very well.
+1	I bought a new play mat because my daughter didnt enjoy being in the other one, it had only 3 toys hanging and was really boring. I bought this one and she loves it! There is a setting and you can make it so the music only goes off when they kick it or play with it or you can have so that is plays for 20 minutes. It was worth the money. My daughter also likes tummy time on this and she hated it on the other one. My daughter is almost 3 months old so i think it is good for even for newborns.
-1	Do you notice the fluorescent light from the yellow part of the elephant rattle? I have been concerned about it ever since I discovered it one day under the blue light of our ceiling lamp.I think safty is the top 1 standard for baby products.
+1	I love this toy. I've used it for my 2 girls and so far there is no show of wear! LOVE IT!!
+1	This product has been wonders for my 1st grand child.  She loves all the activities she can hear and do.  Very stimulating.
+1	We could not live without this gym!  Since my little one was a month old, he has loved laying under this, and he probably spends 2-2.5 hours a day kicking, grabbing, smiling, and cooing while laying on this mat.  We have continued to add toys with different sounds and textures as he has grown, and we move the toys that came with the gym around from time to time.  He particularly loves the elephant rattle right now.  My little guy is now almost 4 months old, and I know this will only get used more over the next few months.  On a practical side, it is lightweight and easy to put together, and the mat itself is washable.  The toys can be moved from the canopy to the mat to make tummy time more fun for baby.  The music leaves something to be desired, especially considering how much time I spend listening to it, but it is worth it to see baby so happy.  Of all the gifts we were given, this has definitely been the most frequently used.A note on battery life: after a minimum of 2 hours of use daily over the past 3 months, the original batteries are still going strong!
+1	This mat was wonderful and we just stopped using it at 13 months, the attached toys are still in use, however. Out of the box this wonderful and whimsical play mat even caught my attention. The giraffe helps hide the batteries and is part of the rainbow supports and also holds a mirror in its mouth. The green leaves are soft and hide a four color light circle that with either classical music or rainforest sounds change colors and pattern with the music. The toys were great for my daughter as she got older say 5 months and up. The parrot has a fun spinner perch, the monkey rattles, the toucan is soft with crinkles wings, the soft monkey has been put on the stroller because she loves its large soft hands and ears.Pros: Great for older babies. Gets and maintains baby&#8217;s attentions. Fun colors and lots of options for play and motor/visual learning and growth.  As our daughter grew, the supports were strong enough to use to stand and bounce a little. Fischer Price really did a nice job choosing materials that easily clean. For those  &#8220;Oh no&#8221; mornings, she would lay under the leaves and watch the lights change and roll to play on her own.Cons: Would have loved if the rainbows collapsed and could be easily removed for travel and/or storage. Takes a lot of C batteries BUT we have not had to replace them even after 13 months of solid use. Can only hang toys on designated soft hooks. Monkey did not come with hanging ring, I had to fabricate one. Overall though a great item and a godsend on most days!Would recommend!
+1	Looks good. I don't open it, it looks very good and beautiful. Hope my daughter like it and enjoy playing on it..
+1	Light weight, easy to assemble and store and entertains without a problem. the music, lights, multiple settings and fun little hanging toys keep our child busy for 'hours'.
+1	este articulo fue embalado en una caja inmensa y a al hora de pagar el envio hasta Venezuela salio en 800 bsf. imag&iacute;nense hubiera salido mejor comprarlo aqui, aunque si nos ahorramos algo pero no fue mucho... con los pocos dolares que da cadivi es mejor comprar algo que si valga la pena (que el envio no sea tan costoso)... por otro lado es muy bueno ya que el bebe se divierte mucho con los sonidos y articulos que trae...
+1	my kids had issued with the swinging parrot with the wheel. My daughter would get her hands/feet stuck in them. we took it off them for my son we tried it again and he would hit it hard and it bruised his head. It's great otherwise. you can always add other toys like rings and dolls .
-1	I have been using this stroller for a year as a full time nanny/baby planner, and I have never liked it. Here's why:- Short handles: I'm 5' 7" and I hate hunching over this thing.- Short seat: He was too tall for this stroller before turning two! And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it. That's pathetic for a stroller- Skinny seat: no winter coats here - especially after baby turns one.- Small, practically inaccessible basket: hard to get to, and holds very littleI could go on...
+1	We've had our Chicco Capri stroller for 6 years and I love it just as much today as I did in the past!  We also purchased it as a "travel stroller" when our first son was born, and it has been our go-to stroller ever since. It's been all over the country, and our 2 year-old now uses it!  Some of its best features are the travel bag (was great when we rented bikes in Key West-- I strapped it across my back and away I went), its light weight, 5 point harness, and fabric durability.  We have a red Capri and it's just as bright today as it was 6 years ago!  The only thing I added was a stroller organizer to the back (cup holder, key pocket, mesh bag) and now it's perfect!  You won't be disappointed!!!
+1	this is the second chicco capri stroller we bought. we bought the tangerine one for my son and this topazio one for my daughter (i don't like the pink one). its great, has decent storage for an umbrella stroller and paired with a sunshine kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, is great for drinks and snacks.the only complaint is that its kinda hard to use the latch to lock the stroller, you really have to press down hard on it.the  cover is a great idea, but honestly, in the year that we have had the stroller, we've never used it, as when we travel, we use it in the airport and check it in at the gate.i wish they came in more colors - like purple!
-1	Yes, it is light weight and folds up compactly but everything else about it I hate.  I am 5'4&#34; and still kick the back wheels often, the red safety lock does not snap easily, in fact, it broke in less than a month of using.  The brakes (front or back) do not lock well.  The canopy got lopsided at one point after it folded up.  It does not recline (I know it says it does, but it really just unzipping the back of the seat).  And the buckle is difficult to click and lock in.  I also have a Bob Revolution for hikes on trails and in parks, and love it.  But we live in San Francisco so I need something light and easy to get around town with my little guy.  I am returning this one, and going to suck it up and spend double of the money to buy an Uppababy G-luxe for everyday use, and we will see how that one is going to go...
+1	I really, really love this stroller. I can open and collapse it one handed, which any mom can appreciate. I feel comfortable with my daughter in the shoulder and lap belt, and the canopy is much better than the cheapo strollers at Toys R Us. The quality of the construction is great as well. I guess I don't see the big deal with the reclining feature, mostly because it doesn't recline very far and my daughter doesn't really like it, but every kid is different.This is a great lightweight umbrella stroller and my only complaint is such a minor issue it's barely worth the time, BUT... I'm average height and the handles can be a little awkward for long walks. If I walk close enough to hold them comfortably, I end up kicking the back wheels. If I keep my distance, I have to rest my palms on the pointed end. It is highly likely that I'm having difficulty transitioning from a bulky, traditional stroller to this model, and that you should ignore this complaint and just get the stroller anyway.
+1	We chose this stroller as our travel stroller for our first vacation which included air travel with one layover each way. We have continued to use it at home when we don't want our full-size stroller (usually when I don't have a bunch of baby gear to bring along or bags to carry at the mall). I found it to be better constructed and more comfy for baby than the cheapy umbrella strollers. I thought it was a step up without being a pricey "lightweight" stroller that doesn't like to be called an umbrella stroller. The color Toapzio is a beautiful pool blue. I did buy it for a boy, but as with almost everything else we buy, I felt it could be used for either gender.Our son was very comfortable in it from the beginning. It is easy to fold up and down. The sunshade is functional, it has worked at keeping the sun out of his eyes. The small basket at the bottom is a little difficult to get to with the way the bars are at the bottom, but you can shove a small bag or a few toys down there. An improvement would be the option to lift the handles up to your level and then push them back down to fold up the stroller. I do like the shape of the handles though. Overall, we are very happy with this stroller and glad we spent a little more for it.
+1	Love this stroller!  It is a breeze to fold up, as well as it's pretty sturdy for an umbrella stroller.  We use this one when we travel, can gate check it at the airport.  It folds up very compactly, goes through the TSA x-ray machine no problem.  The sun shield is detachable, if you are travelling at the airport, would suggest to put that part in the suitcase, and then just take the stroller and the bag it comes with to the gate check.  The bag itself is durable, I don't think that you need to purchase a separate gate check bag, we have been on at least 6 airplanes now, it has withstood at least that many handlings.  It is lightweight and also has a little area on the the bottom to put some items.  I would suggest buying something that can go between the two handles so that you have more space to put things.  When we anticipate that we are going to go somewhere that is kinda bumpy through, we will take our BOB stroller, as this one doesn't have any suspension, and ride can be bumpy if you are not on a sidewalk/pavement.
+1	This stroller has a nicer design and is more sturdy than a regular umbrella stroller.  Some of the really compact umbrellas can be pretty flimsy, while this one has nice wheels, a good frame, and superior fabric and overall construction.  It is a little bit larger as a result, but if your vehicle/travel plans can accommodate, then it is a great buy.
-1	I wanted to love this stroller. It is lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, easy to carry and has a smooth ride. I returned it though after just a few days because it was so frustrating to push. Both me, my husband and my mother kept kicking the back wheels when pushing. We had to shorten our stride dramatically and it was very frustrating. I am 5'6 and my husband 5'9, so this is not because we are very tall people. If you want to be able to walk comfortably when pushing a stroller, do not buy this one.
+1	My son is 16 months and we have been using this stroller for nearly a year.  It has fit our needs very nicely and we are very happy with this purchase.Positives:1. It is very light weight and compact.  Fits easily in our car.2. I can fold/lock and unfold it quite easily with one hand -  with a toddler on one hip and a travel bag over my other shoulder.3. My son seems quite comfortable in it and my husband, parents and I all seem to have an easy time pushing it.4. I like the 5 point harness - especially since we started using it at 6 months of age.5. I love that it does not tip backwards (even when I take my son out) when I hang a bag or two over the handlebars. Very convenient!Negatives:1. It would be nice if it reclined more.2. The material is easy to wipe clean.  However, if it really gets soiled (we brought it to a very dusty third world country for a few weeks), it is difficult to more thoroughly clean.  The fabric says it is machine washable, but the instruction manual reports that the fabric is not removable.  The washing never would have been an issue with "normal" use.Overall, a recommended purchase.  A great step up from the basic cheap umbrella stroller without breaking the bank.
+1	I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4".5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag.  I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK.  A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the "basket". I wouldn't even call it that but it's there.  I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back. This is definitely the best and prettiest umbrella stroller I've had after three daughters so I'm going to enjoy it.
+1	This is a very nice stroller - light (I can hold my child and take the stroller out of the car and unfold it, at the same time); roomy, does not look or feel like a toy, as many umbrella strollers do. I wanted the canopy to cover the back and not to be loose, so the sun always gets to the child, and this one does that. The material looks durable, the 5-point harness is also a nice feature.I give it 4 stars, because when folded the front wheels touch the canopy and make it dirty. The lack of a cup holder is also not very convenient, although not a great minus in my opinion. The back wheels get a little close to your feet, so you might kick them while walking - also not a great issue in my opinion.Out of the lightweight strollers out there, this one is definitely high quality and a decent price. The price on Amazon is $[...] less that the regular retail, which is another plus.
+1	This is a great product. It is light weight and can carry it anywhere. Love the feature that can fold nicely. Good to have it if you live in the apartment.
+1	I bought this stroller to be a lightweight travel stroller. I love it and it is perfect for my needs. It is VERY lightweight and folds up nicely. The height is great and I have no complaints with it whatsoever! I'm very glad I bought it.
+1	This is the perfect lightweight stroller. It opens and closes very easily and I love that it comes with its own storage bag. I can open and close it with one hand and both my 25-lb toddler and 20-lb infant kids fit in it just fine. The wheels glide smoothly and the sun shade blocks out the light for my kids to be comfortable. The color is vibrant and fun. Its a great stroller!
+1	Best umbrella stroller for the price. I was shopping for umbrella stroller for a while, was looking at the more expensive ones like uppa baby or Mclaren... Well, I have to tell I am happy that I did not spend $200 or more for an umbrella when this one is perfect!! It folds perfectly, flat and easy fold. One hand to open!!! Good size storage basket under the seat, I bought additional storage that works great and must have: JL Childress Cup's and Cargo organizer. The stroller is easy to push, my daughter loves it. we already used it for travel and I take this one to the park. The only drawback is, it is not easy to push with one hand (my kid is 28 lbs now) but is not bad. I love this stroller and would recommend it.
+1	Great color! I have a Bob stroller as our main walking stroller, but wanted a lighter weight stroller for my vehicle. This was the lightest stroller I found, 11lbs. I know there are A LOT cheaper umbrella strollers out there, but none that had the shoulder straps and was light weight at the same time. The only minor problem is having to remember to retract the canopy before compacting the stroller up, I tend to forget! It has not damaged it though by forgetting, but it may be bad if you do it too many times.
+1	I just got this for my 5 month old baby girl.  She liked it, but did not go crazy for it as she has for some other toys.  It is very cute, and small enought for a baby to hold, its about 6inch long which I think is a great size for babies since they do not need a large toy to play with. My only concern and perhapes it should not be is that it has little beads inside and beany baby toys. I am sure its safe but the beads worry me if the toy rips they could come out. I am also thrilled that this is not made in china, hence my main reason for buying this.
+1	We called it Moriz and it is one of the best friends of our little one. Moriz is soft and it is easy to play with him. We where a little suprised that he is actually that small, but we like him.
+1	These dolls are perfect for newborns. Bright and colorful, safe, easy to hold. I purchased these in 2 colors for my newborn twin grandchildren.
+1	We are currently using the cups and bowls consistently.  This is the only sippy cup my daughter will take. (We reuse these, not &#34;take and toss&#34; as the name states). Also the bowls with lids are great for traveling.  My daughter loves to hold the spoons. Overall, great value for all the pieces you receive.
+1	Don't use the spoons or forks that came with this set.  However, the cups, lips and containers are great.  As another reviewer said: it is pint-sized tupperware.  Cleans easy but doesn't wear easy.  We use these all day long day after day and the whole thing can fit in my diaper bag on a light day to go to Grandma's.
+1	I like this set. I got everything I needed in one set different colors too. It is a great product very much recommended.
+1	Received this set at my baby shower and we have used and abused these since then!They are very well made and durable and definitely can take a some baby abuse!Love how many pieces are included in the set with awesome bright colors.Would recommend  to everyone!
+1	All the bowls and lids are great, but I especially love the sippy cups. My 8 month old is able to hold them herself and drink without spill.
+1	This set is everything you need to start out feedings with.  Right now I use the spoons and the snack bowls to feed my 4 month old rice cereal.  I wish they still offered the take and toss organizer, but all of these items stack well into each other so they don't take up too much space.  They wash up well, and they are so cheap that if you lose one it doesn't matter.
+1	I don't take food out and about yet for my son - he is only 7 months old right now.  But we do use these at home to mix up foods for him and heat or keep fresh in the fridge.  The sizes are really convenient!  And, they are great for taking stuff to work!!  I use these for salsas and dressings, toppings, etc., for my lunches for work!  I love them!  They are dishwasher and microwave safe - can't beat them.  I am so glad I bought these.  I know we will use them more and more often as time goes on!
+1	I make my own baby food and these come in so handy when defrosting the baby food I have made! They also are great for snacks and it's all in one bag. Great price and they are long lasting.
+1	You will get a lot of use out of this variety pack. I love the bowls with lids, they are convenient for storage and travel. I don't think you can have too many sippy cups or spoons when your baby starts solid. This was an excellent buy.
+1	Great that they offer this all together. I paid less than $15 for it, which is a great deal. You'll pay more if you get them all separate. It comes with smaller snack size containers & lids, then ones that are a bit bigger. All comes in a tot like bag, so they aren't all just thrown in a box and shipped.
+1	I love this!!  It has a little bit of everything I use all the time.  It was so much cheaper than buying individually!!  Highly recommend!!
+1	It simplifies and saves room in your kitchen. You don't need anything else to feed your baby(s), everything is there. Very practical and good looking. It has bright colors. My 10 months old baby is using them since she was 6 months and loves them. They are also safe for your baby to play with. 100% Recommended! Don't forget to get the Take & Toss Organizer. It makes a big difference!
+1	This set includes many different containers that are great sizes for kid food and snacks.  Every container has a lid and the set includes plastic spoons and forks.  The containers are easy to clean and use.
+1	Got this for my 18 month old and its still holding up great 6 months later. One lid did melt in the dishwasher but it fell down to the bottom some how during the wash. I always put these in the dishwasher and everything else is holding up great. Perfect set for little ones
+1	I liked having utensils and containers special for my baby that I didn't have to worry about when we were out. Grandma knows these are ours. She'll set them aside from us. After awhile, I even started leaving a few at her place to avoid needing to remember them. I keep a few empty cups and utensils in our diaper bag and use the containers to pack snacks for outings. Now. I have plastic tupperware and my kids don't mind eating from adult forks. So the selling point for me was the sippy cup.I love the sippy cups.I am guilty of trying out a lot of sippy cups. I've even spent quite a bit on these "cups" that promise a lot for the hefty price tag. But here's the thing A plastic cup is a plastic cup. They all leak to some capacity. As long as the leaking is not taking place while your child is drinking from it-- it serves it's purpose. That is, training your kid to drink from a real cup. (My oldest, who is nearing age 2 is not yet drinking from a real cup. However, if he gets his hands on one, he enjoys pouring the contents onto himself).Yes. This cup will leak if you put it in your bag full of water. I bring them out empty and fill them up when we get to our destination. (It's surprising how many birthday parties we've been to where I'm handed a glass of water for my kiddo... whose dying of thirst and his mom forgot his sippy. I left parties often over the summer whith a topless child and a wet shirt balled up in my hand). This cup was perfect. I also bring one with for walks.. outings to the zoo. I open my water bottle and fill it up outside from my water bottle. If he spills it or drops it, no big deal.My youngest girls are breastfed. They drink from bottle with no problem.. but have only done so two nights that I've been away from them. Since there is no attachment, I've started using these to get them used to cups. I like these because there's no stopper so they don't have to learn to adjust from stopped up cups to non stopped up cups. Without the stopper, this one doesn't leak excessively like other cups I've removed the stopper from.I like teaching my kids about colors with these cups. Mix yellow and blue to get green! (Not that that's a reason to buy a cup... but it's one of the reasons I like this one).The price of this cup is wonderful. After a year, all of my cups look horrid. They go through the dishwasher daily and they have that dishwasher haze that plastic items get over time. These can be tossed. When they melt in the dishwasher after falling to the bottom-- it doesn't make me cringe.I like this product. I highly recommend.
+1	I love storing homemade baby food and her snacks in these little containers. They are small, children eat small. They don't take up a lot of space. Beware the cups if a child is very young. They can pop the lids off with their teeth.
-1	I read so many positive reviews on this set I thought I would love them too.PROS:  They seal very well, even liquids.  I like the smaller bowls because he can hold it with one hand in the car and reach for the snack with the other.CONS:  In the dishwasher the lip of the cups and bowls retains water so I have to tip them over after the cycle is done and let them air dry standing upright.  I have had these for less than a month and the plastic on the mouthpiece of the cups is coming off from my son scraping his teeth on it.  I'm not comfortable with him ingesting plastic so the cups are going in the trash.
+1	The idea of travelling solo with an infant/toddler is no fun. It scares me. Especially if I'm going overseas where access to a target/babies r us is not as easyThis made life easy. It's toss/go so I don't feel badly if we forget it on the plane/restaurant/taxi. I can reuse it! The lids are interchangeable so i can make short sippy cups (great when my son was an infant) and use the tall ones to hold snacks and formula. Now that he's a toddler we'll be using the large sippy cups.I'm travelling abroad again with him and ordered 2 sets of these to take with us. The idea of loosing his woody sippy would be earth shattering so not taking any risks! The pieces are great to throw into my diaper bag and use it at restaurants. The spons/forks will be useless for my 27mon old so that's the only downer to the kit now. They were great when he was an infant.I don't know about you - but some restaurants don't have child proof utensils/cups/plates/bowls so this will allow my kiddo to eat w/o us having to fork over extra money for broken dishes!For the price of this set - it's a bargain! Great deal, great product.
+1	love these! a wonderful staple once baby starts solid foods. we were able to bring a cup, bowl, and spoon to each grandparent to keep which is much easier then transporting it every time we visit. perfect price too! i highly recommend!!!!
+1	nevermind if you have one or 4 children, this kit is essential for every mom who loves the life outdoors.
+1	I really like these products and the price is great.  The forks are a bit thick and do not really work very well.  My son's teacher also says he can remove the lids off the sippy cup, but I have never seen this.
+1	I am very happy with this item! We were afraid to clip our son's tiny fingernails because we didn't want to accidentally cut him or cause him to hate the fingernail clipping process for the rest of his life. Luckily, I read a number of different reviews on Amazon, and found these Pigeon Nail Scissors.These are small, tiny scissors with which to cut the tiny baby fingernails. Baby fingernails are flexible, so they are hard to clip and impossible to file (we tried filing unsuccessfully). Baby fingernails grow SO fast, and babies can scratch themselves easily, and sometimes scratch you.The Pigeon Nail Scissors worked perfectly on the small, flexible nails of our 10-week old. We have had them about a month now, and I've used them several times - about once a week. Those baby nails become daggers quickly! I find a time when my baby is relaxed and will sit fairly calmly in my lap, then I carefully get one finger at a time, line up the scissors and cut. I like these a lot, because you can see the nail so it is easy to line up exactly where you want to cut. It really only takes one quick snip per nail, every once in a while I will go back for a second pass if I cut crookedly or miss part of a nail.The blades seem sharp because they cut so effortlessly. The ends of the blades are curved, like safety scissors. The scissors come with a yellow safety cover for storage.There is not much more to say - these are so effective and useful!
+1	Just got them in the mail. I also think that this is a great product! They have plastic handles, pretty light and perfect for my petite hand. I will try to update if they break or anything else... Hope this helps!
+1	I struggled to find a way to take care of our babies nails. I tried emory boards, chewing, clippers, others scissors, and nothing worked! When I used the clippers I accidentally nicked her skin which traumatized me more than her. But with these it is quick and painless for both of us. The short scissors make them less bulky and awkward than others and the sharpness make them extremely effective. I also love this companies nose cleaning tweezers!
+1	I tried using a baby nail clipper to clip my son's nail.  They could never really cut his nail short enough and always leave a rough edge, so I ended up spending an hour trying to file it smooth (hard to file since baby nails are so soft).  Using a scissor to cut baby nails sound very dangerous to me, but I'm out of options, so I gave it a try.  It worked better than I thought actually.  Of course I did it when the baby was deep asleep.  I found a comfortable position, have enough lighting, then started cutting away very slowly.  It take a little practice at first, and got easier after 2 to 3 nails.  I found for each nail, cutting the corner, then middle, then the other corner works pretty well.  Since every finger is shaped a little different, this works on some better than others.  The scissor is sharp enough that the edges are not rough after cutting.  I've only used it once, but so far I like it.
-1	After reading many positive reviews I have really high expectation for this little nail scissor.  I really want to have a little nail scissor to clip my new born's nail, but this scissor didn't work for us.  It is not easy to clip nail with scissors, I constantly have to worry that I will clip my new born's fingers.  And I keep getting sharp edges on the nails. I practice a couple of times and I finally gave up.  One think I do notice is that this nail scissor can cut very close for the little nails.I think it might be good for someone who really knows how to clip nails with scissors?  but for the rest of us, it is not so easy.  And it is pretty expensive too for a pair of nail scissors and it has been just sitting there for the last couple of months.
+1	Baby's nails too bendy for file, too easy to cut his fingers with clippers. These little scissors are sharp, small, thin, and quick. I feel safer using them than the clippers.
+1	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.
+1	This's a great Scissor for the baby. I'm nervous to clip baby nail. This scissor do a good job to cut the nail not baby skins.
+1	This product works well, I can't say BG's nails are very straight, but I have not nicked her yet, where as the regular clippers caught up some skin and made her bleed.
+1	These nail scissors are extremely sharp and work great. I use them to cut my baby's toenails as it's easier to use the scissors than a regular nail clipper. They also could work well on hands, especially if you're worried about accidentally clipping your baby's skin.
+1	Very nice and sharp. I do not have a problem using it. I am happy I have purchased those as I am not feeling comfortable using a nail clipper yet for a newborn.
+1	After three months of filing my baby's nails due to one cut of the skin that had me swearing I would file until she was 18, I broke down and ordered these.  I am so glad I did.  It took me a while to get comfortable putting scissors near her tiny fingers, but they really are quite safe and once I got the hang of it, I can even do it with her moving around now.  It helps if I make some funny sound while doing it to keep her slightly occupied.  But, I am very glad I got these!
+1	Much better than traditional style clippers for tiny fingers.  Very strong and sharp.  Seem very safe, and easy to use. Worth the few extra dollars.
+1	I have never used nail scissors in my life and was skeptical to experiment but my little one was constantly scratching his face. A friend highly recommended this and I am so glad she did. You can get a great close cut with these and they are super safe. Can you still accidentally cut too close- yes... if you are trying to cut super close its possible to nick the skin under the nails but the blade is thin enough so you can see where and what you are cutting if you are careful. This is a must have for any newborn. I tried filing with an emory board and even the expensive battery operated files but this is much faster and more accurate. Great product.
+1	just the perfect thing to  help tiny cloggy noses. my lil one screams at the site of it but it works!
+1	This seems like it may be unnecessary but they truly are a great baby tool. I found that nose suckers only work when there is congestion and moisture but usually my baby just woke up with boogies. These made it much easier to keep her comfortable and clean. the tips are rounded so your little one doesn't get poked. It is also more sanitary as you can quickly wash them with soap or alcohol. good quality, good tool.
+1	Never thought I would get so excited over booger tweezers... then I had a baby. These things are great - a must-have!
+1	This is an amazing product, instead of using a Qtip I can use this and not stretch my little baby's nose out.  And for my toddler as gross as this may sound, I can use some saline and then reach in a grab those toddler size &#34;boogies.&#34;
+1	Although my son hates these, they work well to get stuff out of his nose.  Never had a problem with them hurting him.  They broke after almost two years when I squeezed them the plastic broke.  Ordering a new one.  Just wish it had a more comfortable tip, but at least it isn't sharp.
+1	I use this along with the nose freida snotsucker and the little noses saline drops and it keeps my 3 month's nose very clean.
+1	This is such a simple design. White plastic tweezers with a rounded tip.  I've used this weekly on my daughter since she was 5m old.  They easily grab those hard to get boogies and then are easy to clean.  I've bought this for many of my friends/family members who are expecting.
+1	Love these tweezers!  Simple product that works great.  I can help my little one get rid of that clogged nose which makes it alot easier for her to breathe when she takes her bottle.
+1	does great the job! quick and easy removes buggies from our 4 month son's nose. i like it better, because saline water made him cry and these tweezers does not
-1	I wanted to like this because I'm all about my baby having a clean nose, but the rounded tips make it hard to see what I'm getting at in his nose. The rounded tips are a safety feature; I understand, but I just can't seem to work around them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe my baby's nostrils are too small; he's currently 6-months-old, but I've been trying to use this since he was a newborn. Anyway, it still sits in his little hygiene bag, but I don't use it at all. Instead, I either just use my pinky or theBaby Vac Nasal Aspirator 2012 Modelaspirator (with saline) to get those boogers out.
+1	these little pickers are amazing!! they remove the boogies so well and they dont bother my 2 mo old when im doing it!! I love them every mom should have a pair the asirator is no god with hard boogies these are a must!!
+1	These tweezers are a far more useful tool than those disgusting snot suction things! You have to be quick and precise with these but they do the trick. The tips are small enough to fit into a newborn's nose and blunt enough that if you do touch skin or nose it doesn't hurt. The tweezer is the length of a normal tweezer so it fits nicely in my hand. It is easy to clean and you don't need any filters or hoses. The only downside is I could imagine the tip breaking off if I dropped it enough times since it's plastic. On the other hand, you wouldn't want metal in the baby's nose anyway.
+1	I can't even tell you how many times I've seen something in my daughter's nose, and thought "I wish I had those tweezers right now". My baby is now 2 years old, and if she would let me, i'd still be picking her nose with these.Yes, it can be scary to think about sticking these into a tiny babe. I didn't start using them until 5 months old. A few times I was probably overzealous, and may have  hurt the babe a little. My advice is to go slow, and get help holding the baby down if they move too much. It is a strange feeling to have boogies pulled out of your nose, I'm sure :) but it works VERY well on those hard, dry, crusty ones that won't budge otherwise.
+1	My 1 month old daughter has stuffy nose sometimes, and we usually use the bulb to suck the booger out.  Sometimes it's right at the front, and the mini tweezer is perfect for the job.  Highly recommend parents to keep this tool around.
+1	I relied on other reviews to buy this product.  I have to say these are definitely going to make your life easier.  When your little baby's nose is stuffed up and is having trouble feeding you will need these.  I have tried the bulb syringe which doesn't work all the time and the baby hates it.  I have also bought a nose aspirator, baby comfy nose, but if you have these you don't have to bother using an aspirator.  I use these just about every other day to quickly and painlessly remove boogies from my two month old's nose.  I am not saying that he likes it but it gets the job done pretty fast and painlessly.  No need putting water drops in his nose which he hates and going through the whole routine of using an aspirator or bulb syringe.  The tweezers are able to get dried boogies and usually pull the wet stuff out with it.  I would say it may take about 5 seconds to get the job done.  I can't say enough about how great these are.  If I lost or broke them I would NEED to buy them again!
+1	I love these tweezers so much. The nose suction bulbs work so poorly in my opinion, but these work great. They've got a smooth rounded end, so you won't hurt baby, but it easily grabs hold of what you're going for! Highly recommend.
+1	My little one is so squirmy when I try to clean her face and nose, and she absolutely HATES the bulb. I had to find a better solution for cleaning out her nose, especially since she doesn't stay still. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase these tweezers and after the first use I fell in love! They make cleaning out her nose relatively quick, definitely easy, and she no longer fights me when I'm doing it!
+1	You have to have this! I admit it looks scary when I try to pick my son's nose with this, but it won't hurt him! Of course you have to be gentle and careful. I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't have this. I am a new mom, so one day soon after my son was born, his nose was so stuffed that he wouldn't eat. I tried the little blue bulb that the hospital gave to me and it didn't work. I was frustrated until my husband remind me that I have this and it worked like magic! It pulled out this huge booger follow by "a mile" long snout. I have been using it everyday since. Here is some tip on using it. Nobody likes their nose to be picked by another, even baby. I usually I wait till my son is in a good mood and he will just let me do it and smile after I clean his nose. When he is fussy, I gave him a pacifier and then pull it out just a tiny bit so I can use this thing. It has been great! Worth a try and you will love it.
+1	My fourth child has suffered from congestion and a stuffy nose since birth. The traditional nasal aspirator did not work well for her, and seemed to cause more frustration than anything for both of us...These tweezers have been great. They just get the job done quickly and efficiently.
+1	Oh my God! I love these. My baby is almost 8 months and I still use them. I have been pulling buggers out of his nose with these since he has a newborn. Definitely a great buy!
+1	Our baby doesn't love these, but they do a great job of removing those pesky boogers. A good friend warns that this can become addictive.
+1	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.
+1	My baby isn't here yet.. but my sister swears by these booger tweezer. She says that she needs a holster for them since she uses them so much. I have a feeling that they will work well for us too!
+1	We tried the nasal aspirators and nothing came out without serious effort on our part and a very angry baby on the other.  These tweezers are just awesome, we strongly recommend them for any parent who has had issues with suction nasal aspirators or the regular nasal aspirators from the hospital.  The round edges are perfect for sensitive baby noses and although our baby (5 months) is not thrilled to have this in her nose, its so quick and easy to use that she's over it within seconds.
+1	These are handy to have to get those dried little boogers in your baby's nose.  The rounded tip lets you get the job done without worrying about jabbing them in the nose.These will not take the place of some kind of aspirator but is just another good tool to have in the baby care arsenal.
+1	The product is smaller than your typical oversized baby nail clippers. Very easy to store. I would buy another one if I needed it.
+1	These nail clippers are of superb quality.  Perfectly sized and precision aligned, the sharp cutting edges make easy work of trimming your baby's nails.  If the alignment were poor, they wouldn't work.  Dull edges and they would tear or imperfectly cut.  These clippers have neither defect.  Try them.  You'll learn that Pigeon makes quality baby items.  You'll not be disappointed.
+1	these work great! I clipped my babies finger twice with regular small finger nail clippers. I am not sure how it works, but I haven't clipped my babies finger since and she is not an easy nail clipper baby :-).
+1	these work great and are super sharp, however, somehow i thought the clipper part would be smaller to work the best for tiny fingers - they're just the size of normal nail clippers.  again they work great but don't think i really needed to get them for my little one.
+1	Small enough for the baby. I have this kind of nail clippers for myself. So I have no problem with using.
+1	I have invested in 3 different baby nail clippers and finally this is the one! I could have saved money to buy this to start with! It's sharp enough to cut baby's thin and soft nails while I feel safe enough not to cut his finger. Easy to hold and easy to use! Seems pricey but definitely worth the money.
+1	I've been using this since my baby was a week old. It works very well on cutting his tiny nails. My only complain is it's too expensive!
+1	I've always been amazed by how the Japanese manufacturers come up with the best products. I have to say, this one exceeded my expectations. It looks pretty similar to my "Summer" brand nail clipper but the experience is entirely different. With this one, it is so easy to cut my 2 month old's tiny nails. I also cut my 3 year old's nails too and it works amazingly well. I would recommend this product to everyone.
+1	Great nail clippers. They are very sharp, which is great when trying to go fast with a fussy baby or annoyed 6 year old.
+1	I was happy to see that this is actually a Medela item in its original packaging. I was unable to find a replacement ice pack for my 5 year old pump in style model until I found this one. This was exactly what I needed!
+1	This ice pack is designed for use with the Medela cooler, which holds four 5-ounce bottles. It keeps milk cold for at least 6 hours, a great help for the pumping mom on the go.
+1	This ice pack is perfect for Medela bottles and carrying pack. I obtained my Medela Pump used without the ice pack, so this replacement part was extremely helpful.
+1	I use this every day to keep my pumped breast milk cold at work.  Excellent product.  Thick plastic that does not warp once liquid freezes.  No leaking.  Everything from Medela is great.
+1	For some reason I lost the original ice pack that came w/ my medela pump, but this replacement came on time and in new packaging, it's EXACTLY the same one that I lost the first go around and it fits perfectly in the insulated breastmilk storage bag that comes with my breast pump.
+1	Whenever we travel with pumped breastmilk, security tends to take these unless they are &#34;100% frozen without a single lose air bubble floating around&#34;. To me it is still worth packing one even though TSA tends to keep taking them from me. At least I know when I get home from a trip I can go online and order a replacement that fits in my medela bag. It is slightly different from the one that comes with the medeal pump, but fits in the milk tote bag, so works for me. Just happy I can even buy it after airport takes it away from my hungry and growing baby.
+1	I have the original pump in style and this is not the same icepack that it originally came with. It still fits in the cooler, but not as well as the original one, but you can still close the bag and everything. Otherwise keeps milk cold and works as expected.
+1	It does what it's intended to, which is keeping the milk chilled when I'm traveling places.  No complaints at all.
+1	It's a good ice ack, very bulky and takes up all the room n he cooler. Wish they would make a slimmer version that was equally effective.
+1	This rattle is easy for babies to hang onto and has a great teething handle.  It is one of my baby's favorites.
-1	Initially I loved this purchase... until today. My 5 1/2 month old put it in his mouth and one of the rings that move around actually wedged in his mouth which kept it pried open until I came to the rescue. He was terrified and crying. I am just glad he was sitting on my lap when it happened. It may be a good toy in the months to come when he gets bigger but right now I hate this product. I'm considering cutting off the rings that move, throwing it away or waiting until he is older to let him play with it. I can't imagine the damage it could have done had I not been there to immediately remove it.
+1	out of the box my daughter choose this toy out of all the rest some thing so simple its amazing
+1	My daughter is 6 months old and she loves this rattle.  She likes to chew on it at different angles, and she seems to like that there are two rattle sounds: the clacking of the rings on the handle, and the pouring rattle sound of the beads in the bubble.  This is one of her favorite toys right now.
+1	Love this rattle. Our daughter loves it so much I ordered this as a back up. She is able to hang on to it, spin it, and use it as a teether.
+1	We have a lot of rattles in our house and the is by far my twins favorite.  In addition, their ocupational therapist uses this for developmental tool.  I would recommend as a must have for any parent.
+1	I tried to buy as many "green" toys as I could for my baby, but in the end other people ended up buying the bulk of our toys.  This was one of the first toys I gave him, and to this day it remains in the top two favorites, along with Winkle by Manhattan Toy.  He could grasp this easily by 2.5 months, and now at 4 months loves to shake it and stuff it in his mouth.  I don't know if it's the colors, the sounds, or the feel of it, but he loves it dearly.  It's kind of funny, because all the "green" toys lie unplayed with on the floor while he plays with this.  Just goes to show you that you can't force your own preferences on other people!It's easy to clean, small enough to carry around in the diaper bag, and appears to be durable.
+1	My daughter has a lot of fun playing with this.  I got it for her when she was 6mos old, she still plays with it now at 9mos.  The one we got is a different color than the one pictured (not that it bothered us; but just wanted to note that colors may vary).  My daughter likes shaking and biting this, but also has fun spinning and watching the beads.
+1	Other than the marbles rolling around in my skull, I'm no expert on rattles. The Bright Stars Grab and Spin seems like a good one though.  I like that the toy is multidimentional with rattling beads encased in hard transparent plastic, a rolling wheel, sliding charms on the handle and bright colors. Also nice is that the charms on the handle are made of a softer material than the hard plastic elsewhere to make any chewing safer and more comfortable for baby.Our thre-month-old grandson enjoys grabbing his rattle by the handle and shaking for all he is worth, a big, broad smile reflecting his enjoyment. For the money I'd say this rattle is a bargain.
+1	My daughter loves this toy, but when I wash it for her, water tends to get inside the spinning area of the toy. So I have to wait for it to dry before my daughter can be entertained with the spinning part. Other than that, the colors are just as pictured, perfect for boy or girl. It is great for teething. It has different textures that baby will soothe their gums with, it rattles so its another plus. It is also lightweight, so it is a Perfect toy for a baby learning how to grasp.
+1	I got one of these as a gift for my baby shower and thought... it's a toothbrush, what's there to say?  I ordered a couple more from Amazon since at least I knew what these were.  Well then we take little one into the dentist since she has 7 teeth and a few more coming in and they give use new toothbrushes.  That night I used the new toothbrush since her first one was all chewed up and she is screaming bloody murder.  I'm thinking that it has to be the new toothpaste... so back to the no fluoride toothpaste and still screaming.  Then I notice little drops of blood at her gum lines.  My poor baby was being hurt by the stiff bristles of the other toothbrush.  Well it's a no-brainer that I put those away for when she's older and opened up one of these and no more screaming kid.  Happy, smiling tooth brushing once again!  I know someday I need to go to a stiffer bristle, but for now these soft bristled brushes will be all I use.
+1	Not much to add to this one.  It is a toothbrush as described.  It is the right size and shape for my 2 year old.
-1	If your toddler is anything like mine, he WILL destroy this brush within a week.  Let me start by saying my son had all of his 1st 16 teeth by the time he was 1, earlier then that actually more like 8 or 9 months.  so he loves using his teeth and he often will chew something to death.  This toothbrush doesn't make it and I found myself buying troughs of them just to use one that wasn't completely macerated.  I did end my quest, but this was the last brand I used before finding the one that worked for me.  Ironically it costs less but does withstand his biting frenzy.  regardless these brushes lasted about a week and it started becoming an irritable cost to have to keep replacing them.  If you have a perfect little toddler that keeps his mouth open and brushes like a miniature adult, by all means these will work fine. But if he or she likes chewing, which is natural for them to do, these will not last long.
+1	The size seems right - my 22 month old son holds it, and is able to put it in his mouth, but the bristles seem to be spraying out a bit from the limited use already, so I'm not sure how much longer it'll hold up. Seems well designed though, with a thicker handle. It's good that you get two - I pretend to use one while he uses the other since he has to have exactly what I have. Ofcouse, he ends up holding both at the same time as well.
+1	We liked the feel and the firmness of the mattress. Our baby sleeps well on it, so happy with the product so far.
+1	This mattress has been wonderful for our son. It fits exactly as recommended by the &#34;experts&#34; and is nice and firm. Highly recommend.Consumer Reports also recommends :)
+1	We had no idea whether this was a good mattress when we bought it - the baby store recommended it and we went along. I guess they knew what they were talking about because this mattress is great. It has held up like new through multiples kiddos, remained firm and in great condition.  Kids sleep well on it, even as toddlers. It is a little heavy and can be hard to get out of the crib especially on the lower setting. Good quality product.
+1	After researching crib mattresses on consumer reports i found this mattress is made of quality material and is more environmentally friendly than most.  so far it is firm and well made.  it was delivered right to my door at no extra charge.  I will know more after a year or so but i am very happy with this mattress.  It is heavy which makes it harder to change sheets but that's because of the coir fiber.
+1	This grooming kit is easy to travel with, and convenient since everything is kept is kept in the clear hard plastic case.  The nail clippers, emery boards, and hair brush work really well.  The nasal aspirator is decent, but the one we received free from the hospital works better.  The thermometer is really cheap and never worked, but that didn't bother me much since we already had a different ear thermometerBraun IRT 4020 ThermoScan Ear Thermometer.  We  haven't used the medicine spoon, dropper, or swabs but I'm glad we have them on hand and accessible. This kit is less expensive than other kits, and overall I've been happy with it.
-1	Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!
+1	I love this bib!  It's the only bib I've continued to use from the time my baby was first introduced to solids at age 5 months until now - he turns two next month.The prints are very appealing to my son (he has the Robots and Dr. Seuss Cat in the Hat), the pocket works well to catch food, and the bib is easy to clean.  This bib really is leak proof and covers a large enough surface area to go shoulder to shoulder and down to the waist on my two year old toddler.Cleaning: For purees and a few crumbs here and there, I just wipe it down with a wet rag.  For more serious dried-on pieces, it can be tossed in the washing machine.  It can also be placed in a bowl with warm, soapy water and soaked, then rinsed.  I don't recommend putting it in the dishwasher.  While it does come clean, the shape gets distorted and it takes a while to lay back in place.The reason I gave this bib 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a bit large for a baby under one year, in my opinion.  As another reviewer mentioned, first baby foods run down his chin and neck and go under the bib, even on its "tightest" setting.  To solve this problem though, I simply put a cloth baby bib on first, then the Bumkins bib over it.  The cloth bib caught any runs and the Bumkins caught the big stuff.  Once my son was on to chunkier foods and thicker purees, I didn't have to double the bibs anymore.This is the only bib I have bought and the only one I continue to use and love!  I just bought another last month just to have two on rotation.  The original that I've been using for about 15 months is still in immaculate condition and looks almost new.
+1	This is a nice bib for feeding baby solid foods. The velcro stays done up, and it is easy to clean. I typically wash in the machine with her clothes, and hang to dry, but I have also washed it in the sink with dishes. It's also cute, and the photos are accurate.
+1	I like these bibs a lot for my son, who is 18 months old.  He is a messy eater, especially as he learns to use utensils.  These bibs provide shoulder-to-shoulder coverage.  The pocket catches lots of dropped food.  They are waterproof and easy to clean by wiping or putting in the washing machine.  I typically wash in the washing machine after every use because it gets them cleaner than wiping, and I hang them to try (which doesn't take long at all).  They have held up very well for many, many washings.  I like that they come in a lot of styles and colors.  These were a great find!
+1	We love these bibs - they are all we use.  They are water proof and the pocket catches the drips, drops, and blobs that occur at every meal.  The various fun designs and washability are also a nice bonus.
+1	While I really liked the Green Sprouts terry cloth bibs when my son was itty bitty, now that he's a bit bigger, we need something with more coverage.  This is a great bib--love that it flares a bit at the shoulders for extra coverage.  The pocket actually works, too, and the fabric looks like new after several washes.
+1	Not only is this bib super cute...it is super easy to clean. Literally just wipe it off and its good to go for next time.Awesome bib...much better than the other wipe clean bibs out there. Will definately be buying a couple more!!
+1	These bibs wash, wear and protect better than any other bib we have tried. And they last forever. They can definitely be used for more than one kid, so buy gender neutral colors and save yourself some money.
+1	These bibs are the best. I've tried others and they stain or don't get completely clean.  Bumkins are the best.  They clean and dry easily. Once in a while I put them in the washer to get really clean.  I love the colors and size- not huge but big enough to cover baby's whole shirt.
+1	The only downside of this bib is that water drips down her chin under the bib (but then again all of our bibs do that). Easy to clean, easy to put on, catches just about everything that falls out of her mouth. We've got two.
+1	We have been using these bibs for the past 6 months for our baby. I love the size as it helps keep her outfits clean, and the little pouch is great in preventing most food from hitting the floor. (Although that makes our dog sad!) These bibs are super easy to keep clean, either through hand-washing or throwing in the washer.  I received/purchases other bibs and none hold a candle to the durability of the Bumkins bibs. Even after 6 months of use, there is no need to replace them at this time.
+1	I love this bib!  It is so durable, yet cute!  My favorite feature us the adjustable neck. Now food is actually going where it is supposed to!
+1	Best bibs ever. Easy to wear for baby, sweet to machine wash, still look great after months of abuse&#8230; Solid recommendation!
+1	My daughter is small for her age, so we have to use a smaller, cloth bib under this one to catch the mess between the bib and her neck.  I haven't had any issues with the pocket not catching food that slides down the bib.  It washes very well and has withstood many washings without showing any signs of deterioration.
+1	Stays on, easy to clean and quick to dry.  Will buy another.  Great gift as well.Fun prints to choose from.
+1	I enjoy these bibs that are waterproof. The are so practical and wash up so easily. Cover baby well too.
+1	This is the perfect on the go feeding bib.  It rinses easy in the sink when we get home, had a pocket to catch falling food, and dries quickly.  It even protects clothing more that others I've tried.
+1	I bought this for my granddaughter who is just over a year and is wanting to &#34;do it herself&#34;. She gets about as much in her lap as her mouth.  This is a big help to save some of the food from hitting the floor.
+1	We have two of these bibs and use them daily. They are great because they have no cloth parts to get gummed up with food and yucky over time. You can just rinse them off after the meal. The pocket does a good job of catching stray food bits (much better than I expected!), and the bib itself has good coverage for our 13-month-old. We've been using these since our son was 6 months old, and they are holding up very well. The only thing I might change (and this is a small thing) is to offer more adjustability with the Velcro closure, especially at younger ages. Sometimes the neck opening is too big and leaves a gap under the chin where food can escape under the bib and onto clothing, etc. But this is just a quibble. Overall, this is our go-to bib for everyday use! We love it!
+1	Perfect bib for beginning to eat babies. Love that it's so colorful and collects most of the dropped food. Only drawback is that now (at 9 months) she can remove it herself.
+1	Love it.  Fits comfortably around my baby's neck, no itchy areas.  Keeps him relatively clean.  Washes easily in the sink after each meal.
+1	Love these bibs. They clean up so easily. They are great for first foods when it's pretty liquid and just slides down the front of the bib. Our baby loves to suck his food off of the bib. It's a really nice texture for babies. I always just wash it off, wring it out, and strap it onto the high chair to dry out. Works great and is always dry by the next time we need it.
+1	My daughter and my son both use these bibs.  They are big enough to catch all the mess.  They wash very easily under the kitchen faucet and dry fast for the next meal.  Great to have for the messy toddlers.
+1	Love these bibs!  They truly keep my toddler clean and no mess seeps through the bib to his clothing.  The only negative thing that I have to say about them is that toddlers quickly learn how to rip them off and throw them on the floor.  A few corrections and putting the bib back on, and everything is status quo.  The fish design is great and gender neutral as well.
+1	Bought this superbib from amazon when my baby started solid. It's definitely the best compared to all the bibs i have. Very easy to clean - just wipe with tissue, wet cloth or simply rinse with water for bigger mess. Easy to carry, not bulky. Good quality material. And my baby cant remove it (yet). Strongly recommend it. Just get 2 of this and you wont need other bibs.
+1	This bib is awesome. We bought two; one for home and one for the diaper bag. They're so easy to clean, and they're still machine washable (hang dry!). They're nice and big: they cover lots and lots of the front of our messy baby. I'm not sure how much the pocket helps, but I'm certainly not complaining.
+1	This bib works great for my daughter. It's a nice big size which is helpful since she is so messy! And the pocket does a great job of catching her leftovers.
+1	We have 4 of these bibs in various patterns for our son, and have been using them for 2 months.  They are wonderful!  They wash up great, don't stain, don't fall apart, and are easy to put on and take off.  We started with this size at 4 months, and although they are a little big on my son's neck, we just double bib him using a regular cloth bib underneath.  I love the patterns.  The owl bib is a particular favorite.The pocket does a good job of catching food and so far nothing gets on my son's clothes unless it's on his sleeves.  But never his lap or chest.  He can pull these off if he tries hard enough, but I'm sure he could do that with any bib of this type.We tried three different brands of this same style.  These are the best!
+1	Have so many different kinds of bibs to use...this is our favorite brand.  Attaches quickly & easily.  Easy to clean.  Daughter likes to find food she's dropped in there & sometimes she spills a large amount of milk or water onto it & it catches it...thank goodness as she's not so good with a cup yet.
+1	it's cheap and comfy; my baby doesn't like any bib, but this one is the only he accepts; the other expensive ones became toys or trash .... never used them. I do recommend it 100%
+1	These are great bibs!  This is the second one I've purchased already.  I probably wouldn't recommend this for babies who are just starting solids (I used the cloth bibs) but these are so great for self-feeders.  They are easy to clean too: I either wipe them down with a wet paper towel or I wash them like I would regular dishes (sponge & soap) for the extra messy meals.  No stains so far on either one (even with spaghetti sauce).  Love these!
+1	This bib has a soft pleasant feel, but seems to be durable as well.  Easy to wipe off, or wash.  The design is even prettier close up than in the online pics.  I am planning on getting a couple more.
+1	These bibs are great.  I have some for my baby girl who is starting to self feed.  They keep her clothes clean and have a soft feel.  Very easy to clean too.
+1	I love these bibs! At a glance, they are pricy. But in the long run, these are far cheaper than the cheap bibs I could've picked up at my local Target or Walmart.  We have some cheapies and they quickly curled and the velcro lost its stickiness. These are machine-washable and the velcro has held up well. They have been used for several months at our house and ours still look new. I'd highly recommend these bibs!
+1	This is a good bib.  The waterproof material and pocket to catch things have made my life easier.  Recently my son gave himself strangulation marks trying to pull this off, so I have stopped using any bibs.
+1	Turtles are my favorite animal so I got some turtle bibs because babies always need a few gave one to a friend and one to a cousin
+1	I tried the cheap Target brand knockoffs with a similar waterproof pocket design and they were flimsy and didn't hold up well at all. The waterproof coating began peeling off almost immediately. I also tried the Baby Bjorn Soft Bib which was more of a rigid plastic. It cleaned up really easily but my daughter hated the feeling of the bib on her neck and always fussed when I put it on. Bumkins bibs are GREAT. Easy to clean and durable.
+1	Once I started using these Bumpkins bibs, I can't go back to any other kind.  They just make so much sense!  We started with the starter bib for the first couple of months and then moved to this size as baby grew.  It covers nicely, especially the shoulders that always get a mouth on when baby turns to look at something.  This bib has saved so many outfits!  I love that when we are done with feeding time, I just take it to the sink and rinse it off and it's ready to go for the next meal.  After a couple of days I do throw it in the washer, but that's just for a deeper clean.  Another genius design aspect, the part where you close the bib is on the side.  Duh!  Makes so much more sense than reaching behind babies head to put on and take off.  If I could change one thing, I would make the velcro a snap.  Sometimes when baby is waiting for food to be prepped she rips it off or tugs on it. A snap would better secure.  Also, from her pulling on it, the velcro is coming un done so I will need to re sew.  Otherwise, it's great!!  I have a few and I always keep one in the diaper bag for on the go meals.  It folds so compact, it's ideal.
+1	We've tried many types of bibs, and these are our favorite. They are flexible, so they can fit behind any highchair tray without bunching up (unlike plastic Baby Bjorn bibs, for example). They are easy to clean, and generally a simple rinse will do. They hold up nicely -- we have some similar bibs that are made from waterproofed canvas that seem to become increasingly warped the more we wash them. They come in many patterns that are pretty unisex, so we can get more than one child's worth of use out of them. Lastly, they are fun and pretty and there are tons of options for patterns. Our daughter actually likes them because they have cheerful patterns, and that's saying a lot since she prefers to go bibless most of the time.Pros: Flexible material, easy to clean, durable, cheerful patterns, fun unisex optionsCons: I can't think of any... seriously!
+1	I have two of these and that seems to be all we need! After feeding my son, I rinse it off, hang it on the high chair to dry, and it's good to go usually by the next meal. Every once in a while, I'll throw it in the wash, but it cleans so easy under the faucet that this isn't a huge necessity. My son is 9 months and this bib completely covers everything but his lower arms. The pocket catches (and holds!) everything, including water, which he sometimes lets dribble out of his mouth after drinking. So to sum up:- Super easy to clean- Good coverage- Pocket is very effective
+1	These bibs are nice! We have the On The Go & Guppies prints. They are eco-friendly, a decent size for my 20 month old and dry so quickly! We can use it for breakfast, completely soak it clean, and it is always dry by lunch or snack time. I like that they can be machine washed. The pocket does not snap apart and that would be nice at times to get crumbs out of the tiny crevices, but I guess that is what the machine washing is supposed to accomplish.The only flaw I have found thus far is that for some reason I thought that they were made in the USA, but they're not.
+1	My 14 month old son is just learning to use a fork and he hasn't quite got the hang of it yet so these bibs have been invaluable. I had other similar bibs from sassy but they were hard to clean- these wipe clean so easily. They also do well in the wash too. They are a nice size and cover most of his shirt. I like that it isn't bulky and doesn't bother my son to wear it. These are the only bibs he doesn't try to take off. They are thin so they fold up really nice for travel or in a diaper bag. Lots of cute prints too.
-1	I don't absolutely hate this bib, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for, especially since it's over-priced and I paid so much for it. Although it is very easy to hand wash and reuse for each feeding (which is why I wanted it - I didn't want to have to do laundry every time my baby ate), it does not accomplish its job as a bib fully. The neck is so big that most of the food gets on my daughter's neck and clothes. So what is the use of wearing it? My daughter is six months old, and her height and weight are in the 95th percentile, indicating that there is a problem with the actual size of the bib. I tried tightening it as much as I could by closing it at the end tip of the velcro, but that did not work either. I don't see her growing into it any time soon.On a plus note, I do like the material this bib is made of. Like I mentioned earlier, it's really easy to wash. I just run some warm water over it and hang it for our next use. However, I do need to find another alternative. So far, I have found the normal cloth bibs to work best, but washing them is definitely a hassle.
+1	I was a little skeptical when ordering these because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I went with my instinct and got them. My baby's nursery currently has all cherry furniture with green/pink decorations and I wanted something that would make it pop so we decided to get white wicker baskets that would fit on her changing table and make it stand out. I was a bit concerned about the "sticky and smelly paint" that a few reviews mentioned but fortunately/lucky for us, mine did not have that problem. Mine came packaged nicely with no broken pieces and as white as can be and without any messy sticky/smelly paint. The sizes are perfect to put diapers, wipes, lotions or whatever you need at hand for baby and all three fit on the same shelf. (I've uploaded a pic) I think I may eventually decide to change the liners but for now we're going to use the ones that came with it.
+1	These baskets are great for my infant's clothing and bath items.  They are different from the picture, though, because the color of the baskets themselves is pink, not white.
+1	I got a pinkmone and it was barely pink. It as a light light dirty white color. Totaly reconmended if you dont care about getting the exact color shown.
+1	Originally bought to go with the baby changing table I purchased from Amazon.  They were actually recommended to go with it.  Well they didn't fit in the cubby holes, grrr!!  I kept them anyway as they came in useful in the nursery and they look good.
+1	I ordered these for our nursery to put on the changing table shelves.  I plan to dye the liner & paint the basket to go with the decor of the room.  When they arrived, they were in great condition (a worry of mine since they are wicker which tends to break easily).  I love the size of all 3 baskets.  The largest will hold diapers, the medium size will probably hold wipes & the smallest will probably hold any lotions, powders, creams or anything else we need for diaper changes.
+1	I ordered these and they are perfect for a baby room. I use one of them for diapers, another for laundry, and the third one holds all of the headbands for my daughter.
+1	The baskets arrived very quickly and were much larger than I expected - both a plus. The only downside is the liners - very poorly made, already fraying.
+1	These 3 baskets are great sizes and perfect for under my changing table in the baby's room. Good quality and good value.
-1	these things have such a strong ridiculous smell, that we left them outside for days before having to return them. theres no way I'm having this poison in my house.
+1	These arrived in terrific shape and were a great purchase for our nursery! They are pretty good sized (especially the large and medium) and will hold a lot of items! I have one just for shoes at the moment, one for small toys and books to keep baby entertained at the changing station, and am still getting organized so am not completely sure what the third will be for - probably other miscellaneous small items in need of a home; maybe socks and booties.
+1	I was recently invited to a few bridal showers and I needed something to put the gifts in and baskets work good because they are easily reusable!
+1	They are not white like the picture. They are pink with pink fabric.  They are slightly cheap looking but they are still very cute in the nursery and I am glad I got them.  I use one for toys, one for diapers and the other one is on display on the top shelf.
+1	We installed a mobile and the paint scratched off almost immediately. The mobile hardly got any use, In fact, the crib was in our nursery and our baby slept in our room in a pack and play so I was surprised the mobile scratched the paint. Other than that it's a great crib.
+1	easy to assemble.  The color is as expected.  I did not purchase the rails, but I do not plan to convert this to a full size bed.  The additional rail to make it a toddler day bed is great, but I had to find a place to store it.
+1	I just got this bed, put it together.  It's real easy to put together, took me about 40min.  It's rock solid.  The metal frame was a bit confusing, the metal hinges are not to be extended parallel to the frame but are angled upwards, then it all makes sense.  I used a lever to make it all level.  Espresso is a good color also.
+1	My husband is not a big fan of putting together furniture, but this crib was very easy to assemble :-) And it looks gorgeous, we get so many compliments! The best: this crib is toxin-free!!! So far this crib was the only one with a finish that didn't have any toxins in it.
+1	Looks great, easy to put together. Very sturdy, and adjustable. I like its build, my wife likes its look. Consumer Reports highly recommends this product, and I now can too.
+1	I like the crib. My last crib was about 19 years ago. They have changed - a lot.It was much easier to assemble than I expected. When my son was nearing the point that I needed to lower the mattress, I was cringing at the thought. As it turned out, my grief was all for naught. Four screws out, then back. It was done.Sturdy it seems. Some thread-lock might have been a plus. It seems the sides get a little loose now and then. A simple screw driver fixes that, but you have to be alert to the potential for things getting too loose.Lastly, there are bite marks 3/4 of the way around the front and sides. Good thing these are the rails that will go away as the crib converts into a bed.I liked it so much I got a second one for my daughter who is still in a bassinet.
+1	My husband and I just put our crib together and we love it. It arrived quickly and none of the pieces were damaged. We didn't have any problems with the finish scratching and we had it together in a couple of hours. I can't wait to use it (I'm not due until May).  I will update after the little one has used it for a while!
+1	It looks great, very sturdy and not hard to assemble.  1 screw was missing though but we were able to buy it from lowes.
+1	Bought matching crib and changing table.  Nice color and sturdy.  Is assembled but not in use yet (baby only 6 weeks old) but look forward to using it.
+1	I just love this crib.  It is so pretty.  I love the design of it.  It is also very sturdy.  More sturdy than I expected it to be.
+1	Though it took some time to put together, after we were done, the crib looks beautiful! It is really sturdy wood, and the espresso finish is great. We put the toddler rail in the closet for later, and the naturepedic mattress fit snugly inside. I highly recommend this crib!
+1	This crib came well packaged, encased in foam padding. The crib was easy to assemble and the instructions were easy to follow. It only took my 28 weeks pregnant self and a friend about an hour to put together. I love that the toddler bed rail was packaged in it's own cardboard box inside the main box. This will allow for easy storage until we are ready to use it. Very satisfied with our purchase so far!
+1	I purchased this for my grandaughter's visits.  Crib was easy to put together, if you are careful it doesn't scratch.  Looks beautiful in the room, is very sturdy and my grandaughter sleeps great in it.  I like that the highest crib placement is very high and makes it very easy to put a sleeping child to bed in without waking her.  I would definately recommend this crib.
+1	I have a baby 4 months old and asked many of my friends what crip I should buy.After a long period of searching here and there, and considerations, I decided to get this item.The conclusion is that this item is fully satisfying my expection and more over.Very sturdy and hard in its frame, the crip also shows a luxurious look.My wife urged me ordered other item(diaper changing table) from the crip manufacturer, so I ordered one yesterday!It took about 30 minutes to assembly it. I had a lot of fun to do that. (needing a screw driver, which was not included.)The only flaw I have to mention is that it gets scratches easily. Be cautious when you are around the crip!However, my wife and I strongly recommend this item.
+1	This crib is really nice. It was so convenient to have it shipped to me. I looked in Babysrus and of course they didnt have many types of cribs in stock and would have to order it to the store from a catalog so I figured might as well order it online from amazon. I'm so happy I chose the DaVinci Kalani. Its sturdy and thick wood. I havent tried converting it yet though, not sure if i will. I might just get a regular toddler bed but its nice to have this option.
+1	I scoured reviews to find the best crib for our baby. The Da Vinci Emily was top-rated by Consumer Reports, but this one wasn't rated at all. The Emily and the Kalani seem very similar, and this one was rated just as well by all the online reviews, so we bought this one in espresso after months of charting out the positives and negatives of all the espresso cribs I could find.First, the positives. It took my husband and I about two hours to assemble this crib. We weren't in a hurry, and the directions were straightforward, but it just took some time to make sure it was all put together correctly. The wood is gorgeous! It's an absolutely beautiful espresso and matches our other espresso furniture perfectly. Everyone is stunned by how lovely this crib is!We've moved once with it already - had to unassemble and reassemble - which was no problem. Our daughter is not quite four months old, so I can't vouch as to long-term wear and tear, but I lean on it often and it is totally sturdy, like you'd expect a regular bed to be. Maybe even more sturdy than a regular bed. In fact, it seems so amazingly sturdy that I've been tempted to climb in there with her!Now for the negatives: Oh wait, there aren't any. I expected this crib to scratch easily because of other reviews, and so we were careful with it while putting it together, but it really hasn't been a problem. I think there are a few small marks where the button of my pants has leaned against it, but you'd have to look close to notice and they are still the espresso color. More like indentations than scratches. This crib is most certainly heirloom quality and far exceeded our expectations. It's one of the most beautiful pieces of furniture we own, and certainly nicer than any other cribs I've ever seen.Update after one year: There are still only a few small marks from jean buttons, but our little darling has left some rather visible teeth marks along the rail. We don't mind them, but you may want to consider a protective cover when your child nears the biting age. Our daughter has probably only scraped her teeth on the thing less than ten times, but each time has left a visible mark. The crib is still incredibly sturdy, though, and we know parents who have converted theirs into a toddler bed now and said they could both sit on it with their child! Still a five-star crib in my book, despite a few teeth marks.Update after three years: We converted this crib to a toddler bed for our little girl more than a year ago. The toddler rail is not as long as I thought it would be... about one-third the length of the bed rather than one-half... which was an issue for maybe a week or two until she learned not to fall out of the bed in her sleep. Since then, though, it's been great for the rail not to be too long, as my daughter and her little brother love to climb in and out of the bed all day long while they are playing that it is a car or house or whatever. It's continued to be a great bed and we really haven't had any issues with scratching. Now that it's a toddler bed, my two children also love to hold on to the end of the bed and jump up and down... it's a great height for them to hold on and jump up and down. Also, we've now tested the weight capacity many times, as I've often laid down on the bed (so that it's fully supporting my weight) while tucking in my little girl at night. It's held strong and we have certainly been glad to have such a sturdy crib and bed all this time. I expect that we will move her into a larger bed by the time she's four, but the toddler bed would probably work until age five if it needed to.
+1	Only using it for a newborn at this point so time will tell on additional options. I own other convertible cribs for my other children(older now) however and they have lasted much abuse.-I'd say the color is pretty true to the photo, it's not really an espresso.-Assembly was great, easy, instructions are incredibly user friendly.-Packaged better than any furniture/product I've ever bought.It(the box) arrived destroyed, but the item was still flawless because of their packaging.
+1	we just put this together and it looks really nice. it was hundreds of dollars less than a very similar model at Toys R Us. It is sturdy and looks nice in the nursery.
+1	We recieved our crib really fast! The box was pretty darn heavy so mama's don't attempt to move it like I did.It took us about 2 hours to put it together. We are pleased with everything about the crib. I was nervous about it scratching easily like everyone kept complaining about We put it together and managed to do it without scraching it at all!!We purchased the Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress. It fits perfect in the crib and it is firm just like we were hoping.WE are very happy!
+1	My husband and I got the package in this past weekend and put together the crib on Sunday in about 1 hour...we thought the instructions were fine and it was very simple to put together. The espresso color is beautiful and we're very glad we picked it. It seems to be pretty stable and well-constructed, although we aren't due until May and obviously haven't used it yet. I'm not sure if we were more careful than others when putting it together but we also didn't get any scratches on it...so not sure if the complaints of easy scratching are valid. The one complaint I do have are the stickers on the wood...
+1	I love this crib but I'm just a little annoyed that it arrived cracked in the back. I didn't send it back but it really is an eyesore.
+1	Really pleased with this crib. We looked at much more expensive cribs in the big name stores, but decided to see what this one was like, and I am so glad we did. It is well made and because we saved so much we were able to put the money into an organic fibre mattress instead. The crib is well made and the instructions were straight forward. Our little lady is just over a year old, so we haven't used the toddler rail, but it looks straightforward when we do. The only negative thing I noticed was the screw holes are visible in areas, but if the only alternative is to fill them with potential choking hazards, I can live with the screw holes!
+1	I shopped around for quite a while and I finally settled on this crib.  It was a more reasonably priced crib that I found.  It arrived within 2 days and was in perfect condition.  The wood is beautiful (we bought the espresso finish).  It wasn't too bad to put together either, might have taken an hour.  I can already tell that the finish will be sensitive to scratching and dings.  A light finish may be less obvious to any blemishes.  Otherwise it is very sturdy and fits a standard crib mattress.  We got the Colgate Classica I and it is a perfect fit!  We also bought the matching changer.  I would recommend this product!
+1	I'm all about getting my money.s worth and this definitely is.  It's easy to assemble, took my husband about an hour. I love how I can use it for several more years. It comes with the half side rail and some extra screws, so I'm assuming you'll need to purchase more pieces for the full size bed.
+1	I put this crib together within 40mins - comes with easy to follow instructions. It is a sturdy and great looking piece of furniture for the nursery. I bought the Espresso alongwith the 6inch Da Vinci mattress and is definitely a worthy investment :)Preferred this over the Da Vinci Emily crib as other reviewers mentioned the gap between the top bars in the Emily crib where little ones usually get their hand stuck. The design of the Kalani crib does not have that gap which will hopefully alleviate that issue in the future.
+1	We have had this crib for 6 months. First it is very good quality, although I can see where the soft wood could possibly get scratched if you are too rough with it. But so far we hadn't had any problems. The crib is really good looking and I think for the price you can't beat it. I will get the rail guards when our baby is older and can stand up because other reviewers said their babies chew on the rails. Overall we love this crib and would recommend it to anyone.
+1	This is a great product. It is built from very high quality pine, and is extremely sturdy. Assembly was straight-forward and the hardware included is excellent quality as well. Our baby moves around quite a bit during sleep, and this crib does not move one bit! As a result, she sleeps very soundly at night. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
+1	VERY CUTE crib - we were going for style and price, and this worked out well!  The paint on the sides started to chip after my teething dauther did a number on this.  We put padding around the top, but she just pulled this off and has bit/slobbered off enough paint.  What can you do?  Kids like to destroy things....
+1	We like the crib so far. It looks pretty and seems very sturdy and stable. No complaints about the quality either. Will have to post an update in a few months when our daughter will be able to pull herself up and move about it more.
+1	Once this crib is assembled, it looks beautiful! The finish is a little darker than I was expecting though. It is also VERY difficult to assemble. It took my husband and myself an hour and a half to put together. I am decent at furniture assembly, and this is the most challenging piece I have EVER put together. I understand that the &#34;locking washers&#34; are necessary, but they are the biggest pain! If you are awful at furniture assembly, I suggest you find someone to do this for you!
+1	I'm happy with the crib so far. Assembly was easy, took about 1.5 hours total. It looks beautiful, but did end up with a few minor scratches from assembly. Be careful when putting some of the last pieces in to avoid this. (I also bought a cherry wood paint pen at Home Depot, meant for touching up laminate flooring scratches I believe, and the few tiny scratches are now gone!)Overall, it looks very nice and seems very study and stable for a reasonably-priced crib.
+1	Received the crib recently, came less than a week after I ordered it, and everything was packed very nicely.We put it together last weekend and it looks gorgeous.The only issue was that some of the bolts did not easily work with the screws ... so it took a little bit to get the bed put together. We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material. I know it is a soft wood - so we'll need to be a little careful with it.It looked really high when we put it together, but now that the mattress is in it's fine.Very pleased with this choice.
+1	It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched.
+1	I bought this crib in black.  i am so happy with it.  my husband was able to put it together pretty quickly.  it does "dent" and chip somewhat easily, but i will keep the black sharpie nearby.  it is very sturdy.  i will say that our baby isn't here yet, so this review is not based on daily use or having used with a baby yet.  i will try to remember to update this review after baby.
+1	Love this crib! Haven't put the babies in it yet, but will soon! They were very easy to set up, and the finished look is beautiful. We are expecting twins any day now, and ordered 2 cribs to sit side by side.None of the pieces were damaged, and we weren't missing ANY parts. I love that they also come with the toddler rail for future use.The only thing (very minor) that I would like to have seen different, is the color of the screws that show on the outside. They are a gold-ish color. If they were white in color, it would've had a slightly more 'finished' look. But that is easy to fix yourself at home if you wanted to :-)It was difficult to order this crib b/c every where I went said it was sold out (the white only) then it would be in stock for 2 days and sold out again. I'm guessing the white is very popular. Finally we got them, and they came in 2 days with PRIME shipping.Overall, a very satisfied customer so far.
+1	I bought the cherry version of this bed for my granddaughter who is now three and using it in its toddle form, so I made this second purchase for the next granddaughter, with complete confidence. The crib is strong, looks good, takes some perseverance to put together, but is well worth it.
+1	This bed was purchased for our first grandson who has not arrived yet.  The only problem was when it was delivered by UPS the box and the bed was damaged.  They had this bed picked up and another delivered within 2 days. Our son put the bed together and it looks so nice and sturdy.  Our grandson, Autry will love it as much as his parents we hope.  GREAT CHOICE :)
+1	This arrived super quick!  I ordered it on Tuesday night and it was on my doorstep on Friday afternoon.  It arrived in perfect condition.  It was pretty easy to put together, it only required a philips screwdriver to put it together.  Make sure you have plenty of room to put it together and two sets of hands.  I tried to put it together by myself and some of my boards banged together and it did leave some marks.  But other than that the product arrived perfect and the color was beautiful, I ordered espresso.  I am very pleased with the crib.
+1	Nice crib for small place and baby can be rocked when sleeping, that makes my girl sleeps longer. Love it!
+1	The crib arrived in good condition and looks very nice (the espresso finish looks good). It will easily chip or mark in the future due to the light quality. However, it was easy to assemble and the mattress pad provided with the crib was not too bad. Nevertheless, I had already purchased a 3 inch mattress as recommended by other reviewers ( 5 inch may be too much and not needed for a crib this size). The rocking feature seems to work well for now - we will attach the wheels later when we no longer want to use the rocking feature. The crib was easy to move through doorways. Overall, pleased with the purchase - considering the price was not a lot. Will update the review after using to see how it holds up.
+1	My children are 18 months apart in age. I did not want to buy two full sized cribs (and in our previous house, we wouldn't have had the room!). I bought this for my son and he happily slept in it for well over 1 year. The wheels are so nice to be able to move it from one room to another as needed. I bought a smaller mattress, smaller sheets and a smaller bumper to fit this and make it cozy for him. At 16 months (30 inches and 22 pounds), he still fits into it just fine, but I've since moved him up to a full sized crib as his sister is in a toddler bed!
+1	Used when our granddaughter visits.  Didn't use the rocking part.  She sleeps well at our house. Be sure you put it together in the room you will use it in if you have narrow doorways.Overall, very happy with our purchase.
+1	We have a crib from 2012 (with the plastic teething guard), and so far it's performed well. Too bad the rocking feature wasn't useful for us, but it was nice to have just in case. The small size has been invaluable, and the natural version's lack of paint is great (though it is varnished).The part that supports the mattress IS particle board, but of the type that doesn't seem to smell.In addition to the previously mentionedDavinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 Coil MattressandAmerican Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet(thanks to the people who mentioned them!), other accessories I personally have found useful include theHiSense BabySense V Baby Safe Infant Movement Monitor(with 2 sensor pads, it covers the whole sleeping area),Go Mama Go Designs 24 Pack Wonder Bumpers, example listing(padding to go on each individual vertical slat), and custom-made/hand-crafted cloth railing covers (which can be ordered online from actual craftspersons, avoiding problems like flame retardants). The last are needed because with or without a plastic teething guard, there's lots of exposed wood and varnish in chewing range.Two caveats with the extra mattress purchase listed above is that it does add a few inches of height, meaning standing/climbing/jumping babies may outgrow this crib sooner. Also, it is springy, meaning any fall could result in a bounce, which could be right into one of the sides.
+1	It's beautiful, more sturdy than it looks and is so easy to put together. It took about 20 mins to assemble. Be careful with the metal corners when you put them on, they will scratch the wood if you scrape it by accident while trying to line up the holes. Comes with teething rails, which was a nice surprise. Baby is on the way, can't wait to see how she fits in it. The mattress it comes with is nothing more than a thin plastic pad, so purchase a good one! The frame alone is worth every penny =)
+1	This is my fourth mini crib from this company they work amazingly in my small daycare space for my infants! Would purchase again without hesitation.
+1	We love this crib!  The baby has been sleeping in it pretty much since we brought him home from the hospital, and he's now 7 weeks.  He's right up near our bed like a bassinet or co-sleeper, with just a little extra space for walking and rocking it.  I can sit up in bed and peek at him or reach in to check that he's breathing!  We needed something that would fit in the corner of our bedroom (we live in a 1 bedroom condo) for at least a year.  This fits easily, even with space to rock, and will be plenty big enough for the baby for quite a while.  It's safe and sturdy, super cute (we got it in white - no issues with paint chipping yet and it seems well done), and the rocking feature is awesome.  My husband uses it when he puts the baby down after a night change; I use it when he doesn't need anything specific but is a bit fitful in his sleep (baby not husband).  Haven't had any cause to change over to the wheels but I'm sure they come in handy for lots of people.  It is a little tricky to find things that fit, but they're out there.  We went with the equivalent of the Crescent 50 coil mini crib mattress and the American Baby fitted crib sheets and waterproof cover, all of which have worked out great as far as fit and durability, and hence safety.  In short ~ we did a lot of crib research and are glad we settled on this one!
+1	I was using a pack and play but the thing was driving me nuts. My daughter slept in the bassinet area but it wasn't locked into place and it would sway whenever she moved and it would wake up my light sleeper. This mini crib is the perfect replacement.  I wish I had known about them earlier!This mini crib has the option of using wheels on the bottom or having a curved base for rocking. We put the wheels on, which makes it easy to move for cleaning the room, though it is still sturdy and stable for sleeping.  The height of the mattress is adjustable and there are several levels to choose from, not just one or two.  The mini crib can support higher weight limits than a pack n play so I don't have to bend all the way over to put her down or get her out, even though he's starting to weigh more.  I love that.  The color is exactly as you would expect and arrived in perfect condition with no scratches or chips.  In fact, we've been using it for about 5 months and we haven't put any dings in it ourselves.  That's pretty good.  Easy to put together and my husband had the job done in less than half an hour.Like pretty much an other crib, my daughter can slide her arms and legs through the slats so we bought a breathable bumper so she doesn't fall asleep with a limb hanging out and try to roll over.Uses the same mattress size and sheet size as a pack and play.This is on my list of essential items for a baby.
+1	My baby was 5 month when I purchased the crib last month. She likes it a lot and she can sleep well in it. But crib bumper is a must have  for her to avoid stretching her legs and hands outside the crib.
+1	This crib is one of the nicest piece of furnature I have bought for my grandson.I love the different levels to adjust the bed.It small enough to sit in my living room and I move it to my bedroom easily if he spends the night.Company had a fast delivery. Crib went together easily in an hour. Very Very nice....
+1	I love this crib.Let me tell you why.1.  It fits in doorways, meaning you can move it from the nursery to your room without breaking it down.  My baby hated the sleep and play thing that I had planned to use in our room, so I moved this one in our room at night, and back to nursery for naps.  Took about 3 mins at night, and 3 mins in the morning.2.  It rocks.  Literally.  You can rock the baby to sleep which helps them learn to go to sleep without being held.  Or when they fuss at night.  He is 7 months old, and we still love the rocking feature.3.  Well made.  As much as we move it, it is still tight and holding up great.4. Space saver in shared room.  My older two had full size cribs, which seems silly now.  They both were climbing out of the crib long before they ever got close to outgrowing it.  Babies are small, duh.5.  It is pretty.  It doesn't look like you old school portacrib.6.  You can lower the matress REALLY low, like to the floor low.  Which is great for my 7 month old who pulls up in it all the time.  I don't think he'll be able to climp out for a long time.Things I don't like:1.  You have to buy an additional matress because the one that comes with it is only about 1 inch thick.  But for this price...not a big deal.
+1	I have two grandchildren 7 months apart both coming to stay at the same time. I had a pack and play but needed another crib, so I ordered this mini crib, and was delighted by it. I was able to put it together myself, and it is easy to maneuver through doorways. It takes up so much less room than a full size crib.
+1	LOVE this crib.  It's the perfect size and my little girl is just turning two and still loves it.  We're so glad we purchased it for her crib.
+1	We bought this to use in our room to make night time nursing easier but this could easily be a full time crib until I'd say about 18 months then it might be a little small.  It's very sturdy, the finish is nice, and it arrived in excellent condition.  I did buy another mattress for it but am using the foam mattress that came with it in the bottom of the pack n play.  This is the same size as a pack n play and you can use your pack n play sheets.
+1	I live in New York City and space is at a premium. This little crib is absolutely perfect. The quality is great (looks far more expensive than it costs!) and it was easy to put together. Comes in just a few pieces and my husband put it together on a Saturday morning before I woke up - he assures me it was simple! We bought the upgraded DaVinci 5.5 inch mattress which is also great - fits like a dream. Purchased custom mini crib sheets from Sheetworld.com as recommended by other users and they also fit perfectly. Overall, thrilled with the purchase. Looks great and can't wait to rock the baby to sleep when he arrives in a couple months. (BTW, I have a friend who also lives in NYC and purchased one of the other DaVinci cribs. Her baby is over 1 year old now and still happily sleeping in this little crib. I'm hoping we can use this right until we put him into a twin bed - which will no doubt be earlier than if we had a bigger crib, but I'm hoping it won't be a problem.) Highly recommend!
+1	My husband and I ordered this to keep in our bedroom.Assembly took him no time at all and it looks really lovely once assembled.We opted not to put the wheels on it so it could rock but I do not feel they would take away from the overall appearance of the crib at all.I was worried about what sheets would fit best with this crib, but American Baby Company makes fantastic mini-crib sheets that fit it perfectly. They even have an organic cotton option which we ordered.I'm so happy with this purchase because unlike a bassinet which can only be used for about 3 months, our daughter will be able to use this crib for much longer.We have another DaVinici MiniCrib in her bedroom that we are also very happy with.From what I've seen so far, DaViinci makes great products and I would order from them again in a heartbeat if we need anything else.
+1	We bought this crib when my wife was pregnant, and our daughter is still sleeping in it at 19 months.  We never did use the rocking feature, but left the wheels on full time so we could move it from room to room as needed.  We have a relatively small house without a lot of open space to move or store things, and this crib is the perfect size for us.We also bought theCrescent Mini-Crib Mattress, which is 6" thick, and we had trouble finding fitted sheets for it.  Fortunately, we found theGerber Brand Organic Crib Sheet, which is actually designed to be a full-size crib sheet, but all the reviews complained about how it was way too small.  We bought a couple of them, washed them in hot, and they fit perfectly on the mini-crib mattress.We also added theBreathableBaby Crib Bumper for Slatted Cribsas a crib liner.  It's a thin, open mesh that allows for easy breathing as well as some visibility, but keeps little arms and legs from getting outside the crib through the slats during active sleeping.Put all those together and we have loved our crib.  The crib itself assembled easily, and the mattress platform has several height positions, so it can be set in a high position for use as a bassinet during the early months, then lowered as the baby grows to prevent crawling out over the rails.  It's been durable and practical, and continues to look great even after 19 months of hard use.
+1	I am so in love with this crib, it's not even funny! My first was a terrible sleeper, we started him in a bassinet and he hated it so we ended up co sleeping for 4 years, yikes! I was determined not to share my bed so we bought this and it has been wonderful. I can feed my baby girl them when she's sleepy but still awake I will place get in the crib and gently rock her to sleep. If she startles I just rock the crib a bit more and she goes right back to sleep. I have been able to sleep in 3-4 hour stretches since we came home from the hospital. If she stirs in the middle of the night, I just rock her for a few seconds and she puts herself back to sleep.They mattress is a bit thin so I bought a 2.5 inch one and it works well. Also have a portable crib breathe bumper that fits perfectly.
+1	I will tell you that this is the second night my 2 year old son is sleeping on it but so far we love it! Easy to put together, it only took my dad and my hubby 20 minutes.. VERY sturdy, my dad laid on it after it was together and it didn't move or bend at all and he probably weighs 230lbs but it's light weight and easy to move. I like that about it. It's got a nice amount of space on the inside, my son wants me to lay by him for a little bit at bed time and it fits both of us ok and I'm 5'8 and 8 months pregnant.lol The wood is very nice and I love the cherry finish. My son loves his new big boy bed and even likes to lay in it to just watch a movie. I'm very happy and would recommend it to anyone.
+1	I purchased this bed for my daughter who was just over two years old.  We had another baby on the way and wanted to transition her from a crib into a "big girl" bed before our son arrived.  This is the PERFECT transition bed.  It sits very low to the ground so it was easy for her to get in and out of bed by herself.  The one or two railing option is also a great feature for those that want a little more security when using this as a transition bed!! Our daughter slept wonderfully in the bed from the first night! She is now almost three and still loves sleeping in this bed.  The construction quality is also much higher than I expected for the price.  I would highly recommend this bed!
+1	it took a week to get her to sleep in it though, and after a couple of months, she still doesn't get out of it in the morning and waits for me to come get her.assembly was quick and easy, although the directions were somewhat lacking, it seems sturdy enough, but I wouldn't lean on it, and definitely do not lay down in it!  I think the bed will &#34;barely&#34; support the max weight listed for it, and if a child jumps on it, expect the supports to break.
+1	Love it!! 4 stars because it seemed a little smaller than I expected. It's really cute though! :) I'd buy it again.
+1	I opened this bed up to assemble it and noticed right away that the Oak finish on one part was defective, it looked like there was excess finish that dried on there from the company.The reason why I'm still giving this bed 5 stars is because this company is amazingly fantastic, I called them up and explained the defect and they are sending replacement parts, no questions asked and no hassle.I still set this bed up in the meantime, it is extremely easy to assemble, looks fantastic despite that one area and I highly recommend this toddler bed!I really honestly believe that my bed being defective with the finish is not the norm.
+1	Holds adult weight.  Terrific value.  We purchased organic mattresses to go along with it.  It matches the DaVinici mini crib.
+1	Sleigh Toddler Bed - OakMy husband and I recently purchased this bed in oak for our 26 month old daughter.  It was time for her to have a "Big Girl Bed" that wasn't quite full-sized, but still gave her the ability to get in and out on her own.We're thrilled with the quality of the bed.  My husband was able to put it together in a reasonably short period of time (about an hour from unpacking to clean-up)--and came with all the tools necessary to put it together.  Aligning all the slats can be a bit of a pain because you have to put all 10 together on one side, and then attempt to put the other side on without them falling out or slipping out of place; other than that it went together fine and all the pieces fit together without any problem.It fits a standard sized crib mattress (not included), and the bottom slats provide enough stability for the mattress so that even my eight year old has been able to throw her weight on it (although I did tell her not to do it again).  So regular wear and tear from your toddler getting in and out shouldn't be an issue.I like that it is light enough so I can easily move it around, but it is sturdy and heavy enough that it doesn't budge when she gets in and out.  There is also enough room between the mattress and floor that you can easily swoop your arm around to remove lost toys that inevitably make their home under there.I was worried about the sharp corner on the guard-rail, with good reason.  My daughter has bumped her head on it a few times (I have no clue how), so we drape a large sherpa blanket over it and the mattress to add some padding--plus it gives a little extra protection for the sheet should she wet through her diaper.  That seemed to do the trick.  Other than that, there don't seem to be any other downsides to the bed.And the best part is our daughter fell in love with it, and enjoys going to bed in it (well, she isn't exactly running to go to bed; but she wasn't afraid of it at all, and actually enjoys taking ownership of it).  I definately recommend this as a transitional bed for your toddler who isn't ready for a full-height bed.  The quality is great and the price is reasonable.
+1	Bed was somewhat easy to assemble.  It took about 1 hour by myself.  The slats were the most difficult to assemble, would be much easier if you had 2 to align them.  Bed looks great.I don't like that the bed is rated to only 50 lbs.  That part was disappointing since I want to be able to sit on it with my child.  My husband (165 lbs) did lay on it before I could tell him not to and it didn't break, so I guess that is good but since it is rated only to 50 lbs, he won't be doing that again!The standard crib mattress that I purchased fit perfectly.  The flat sheet and comforter are hard to tuck in since you have the rails.  My 20 month old can easily climb on the mattress by himself.  He hasn't fallen out of it because I haven't had him try to sleep in it yet, still getting his big boy room ready.
+1	For our daughter we chose not to go the convertible crib method and at about 1 1/2 she was ready to move into her first big girl bed.  We went with this DaVinci and could not have been happier.  It was very sturdy and stood up well to her occasional bouncing sessions and Daddy (165lbs) taking little naps with her.  Now that she's 3 1/2 years we are ready to move her into her a single bed so we can use her crib mattress for her brother.  Had he not come along this toddler bed could easily have been used up until she was 5 or 6.
+1	I really like this bed, so does my 2 year old!! It's beautiful and seems to be a good quality product.The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is NO WAY I could sit on the bed and read my little girl a bed time story. I realize this bed is for toddlers and is built accordingly. But I would like to be able to sit next to her and read or rub her back to calm her down. On the other hand, it is pretty close to the floor-which is where you have to sit to comfort your little one..
+1	We've had this for a few months now and its a very nice bed! My son is 18 months and he can get in and out very easily! No niches or scrapes when we received it and it only took a week to receive it. Also we bought the sealy soybean foam mattress with it and its amazing!
+1	When this bed arrived, I was a little concerned since the box had a huge gash in it, but everything was in perfect shape. Putting this together ranked in difficulty between 0 and IKEA. Once we put it together our toddler was super excited but, has yet to sleep in it. It seems to be pretty sturdy, it held me and my toddler on it together (yes I know it has a weight limit but try telling that to a toddler who wants you to share her pillow as she demands "NAP". LOL It matches our DaVinci crib which was a concern when we originally ordered it, since they are both different colors but the Espresso crib and the Cherry bed actually match pretty darn close.
+1	My son loved this as soon as he saw it. It was easy to put together and looks nice. He feels likes such a big boy in this bed.
+1	Great bed! Transitioned my 2yr old daughter to this bed after her crib and we LOVE it! She does too! She was so excited to have her first real bed and wanted to go to bed right away when she saw it! It is rich in color, very well done and sturdy. I sit on it (150lbs) often and I have layed down with her a few times with no problems! She sometimes walks on the bars supporting the bed underneath when we remove the mattress for linen changes (she is 38lbs) and they hold her.  The standard crib mattress fits snugly right into this frame with no problem. We actually purchased a memory foam padding (twin size) and cut it to fit her crib mattress and encased in a mattress covering. Crib mattresses are so hard and we really wanted her to have comfort now that she is old enough to not have a hard mattress. All this fits great in this bed. The bars are great keeping her from rolling out of bed. I usually find her backed up against them while sleeping so glad they are there.  My only gripe is that we had the davinci crib which was supposed to convert to a toddler bed but did not work out so we had to buy this product. Anyway...glad we did because it is perfect for her. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed!
+1	Bed came well packaged (box is heavy).  Espresso color is beautiful, bed is made of quality durable products. There were a few &#34;nicks&#34; on a couple of the pieces the mattress rests on, but since they will be covered, I didn't mind.  Easy enough for one adult and a very helpful two year old to assemble in a half hour or so (although a second set of hands would have made it even faster/easier).  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFEs very durable!  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFECT.
-1	We had to buy this in a hurry because the product we had wanted (and ordered from Amazon) suddenly became unavailable.  What a poor choice!  The back panel is not even the right _size_, so there's a gaping hole in the back of the dresser.  Tells you a lot about the manufacturer's quality control.  The whole thing feels flimsy and cheap.  I'd be worried about putting a baby on top of it, it feels ready to fall apart at any minute.  My husband put a dent into this thing with his _nail_ -- exactly what is it made out of??  I wish I had known that it was made of this kind of cheap stuff, it certainly shouldn't be for the price of it.  Bottom line -- waste of money.
+1	We received the item in good condition as it was well packaged.  The directions for assembly were clear, so my husband was able to assemble it pretty easily (although he *is* good at that sort of thing).  It's a very useful size for our relatively small house.  I love the changing table on top with the decorative & functional (safety) bars.  The drawers are pretty spacious for pre-fab.  We were impressed that most of it was real wood & only side & back panels were pressed wood.  The color is much to our satisfaction as well.  Overall, we are very pleased with this online purchase which is far more than we can say with many of our recent purchases (even local).
+1	Bought this and the matching crib--LOVE THEM BOTH!  Very easy to put together--easiest if you have 2 people though.  We accidentally used the wrong screws in the beginning which resulted in drilling thru the outside, but unless you're looking for it, it's hardly noticable.  Love the quality--some say it scratches easily, but have not found this to be the case with us.  Highly recommended!!
+1	I bought this DaVinci Dresser/Changer in cherry, after reading every review I could find, about this and other comparable dressers and changing tables over and over to find the best one.I must say, I'm really happy with it.I bought it with the 4-1 emily crib both for 490$ at [...].I recieved them in perfect condition. My husband put it together by himself in about 2 hours, I watched, if you just follow the instructions even if it doesn't seem to make sense at first, you'll be fine.I'm using it now for almost 4 months, and it's great. it's higher than most other changingtables, which is good for your back( I'm 1.63m tall), the rails give some extra protaction agains rolling off.The changingpad seems perhaps thin in comparrison with the regular ones, but it is thick enough and feels comfortable.You don't need to buy another pad. My babygirl really loves laying on it. I use a softtowel as a cover. She often falls asleep while I'm changing her or clipping her nails or something.The drawers are sliding smooth, and hold up diapers, cloths, blankets, towels. it's just perfect. ofcours you shouldn't open the drawers using one nob( like I often do) because the the drawer slides a bit square and it scrathes the dresser.If you asemble it right it is very sturdy, even though it's not completely made of wood. It has some scratches but still is beautiful..I don't wear cloths with a belt or jewels because of the baby.bottom line: I'm happy with the buy and really think you will too.Update:My girl is now almost 7 months old... I still love the dresser. It's still beautifull, I noticed that the bottom of the drawers are a bit bend in the centre, but I really put alot in them, and it doesn't effect the functionality.I noticed that most changing pads are a lot shorter than this one and I am really happy with mine. My girl still fits on it with room to spare for things like babyoil etc. she's about 65cm tall, weights 8.3 kg.I can't imagine not having this dresser... It's well worth the money.
+1	This is the perfect changer/dresser.  We love it - it's easy to put together and compliments any room.  The only con was the chaning pad...so we just bought a changing pad to put on top...which we will take off when he's ready to use it just as a dresser.  The drawers glide well, and are roomy.
+1	This is a beautiful crib and it is well worth the price. it was easy to put together. It took my husband and I less than 2 hours. It looks great in the nursery and we are really happy with it.
+1	We got this crib in "Natural."I've got to say, it's a beautiful crib that is pretty much the focal point in the nursery.  It's sturdy, even if it does tend to scratch easily - the only thing I was tempted to deduct a star for.The fact that it's convertible... well, we haven't gotten quite that far yet, but it's very nice to know that we won't need to spend any more when the time comes.
+1	This is a superb crib. I am very happy withthe color, apearance and even the quality. It took 1 hour for us to assemble it. Very easy. Nice directions. Perfect crib.
+1	This is a great crib at a great price. Assembly instructions could have been a little clearer but nothing unmanageable. It also does ding/scratch easily, so giving it 4 stars. The honey oak color is lovely.
-1	Missing parts : (4)x Post rackets and (12)x wood screws 5/8" in the package.Document: missing instruction .  It is  donwloaded from internet. Not sure instruction downloaded is most updated.Package is not packed carefully. Tape  wrapping around  box looks old.
+1	I purchased this crib after researching the Consumer Reports research on cribs. This particular crib earned CR selection as RECOMMENDED, which definitely got my attention as they tested every aspect of it for safety and usefulness. The crib is fairly easy to install, although you might probably need the help of a second person. Million Dollar Baby (The Manufacturer) takes fair measures to protect the item while shipping. My personal experience was that some of the parts came in scratched or cracked. I contacted the Company and they sent a replacement that took WAY TOO LONG (like 3 weeks), only to ALSO arrived scratched!! I couldn't wait anymore so I decided to use the less scratched part since my baby boy was about to be born and I wanted everything to be ready. As far as construction goes, this crib seems pretty sturdy (if you install it correctly). I love the fact that this crib can be used by your baby basically all his life living in your house, as it can change to a full size bed! It is a very good investment because you have a crib, a toddler bed and a full size bed in one. It comes with all the parts needed for use as a crib and toddler bed; for the full size bed you have to buy the conversion rail kit which sells for around $90 here on Amazon. I like the fact that an Entity as Consumer Reports backs it up, because they test every item to the fullest extent possible in every possible aspect; so if they recommend it, that gives me peace of mind that the item should be safe and good quality (although as a responsible parent you should always keep a watchful eye and check everything twice). Recommended.
+1	We bought this for our daughter's nursery a year ago. My husband had it assembled fairly quickly, and it looks beautiful! The color is great, too. Our daughter is now 11 months old and pulls herself up with the bar in front but I've had no problems with her getting her arms stuck or anything. It is a great crib and great quality. I will definitely buy another one like this when we have another baby.
+1	Although we bought it last July 2012, we just set it up this month for our growing baby. Her cradle was the same color, so the transition to the new crib was easy.Set-up: My husband started it and was having a difficult time matching the right washers and pegs, etc and he was using a drill. The wood is very "sensitive" and gets scratched easily. (We just used a magic marker to cover those minor scratches). Nothing is perfect. Since hubby was tired and then got sick, and I had been waiting for the crib to be ready to use for weeks, I finally took over while he and baby slept. I used a small hand tool (as recommended in one of the instruction papers) and was able to finish it after a total of two hours.Overall, we are very pleased with this product. We love how it looks and how sturdy it is. Hopefully it will last us a while for our future little ones...And our daughter loves how spacious her crib is (compared to her itty bitty cradle!).
+1	The crib looks better than several high end cribs ont he market. The pine wood is excellent quality and is sturdy. It was bigger than I expected it to be. We purchased Sealy ultra baby Rest mattress which is a perfect fit for this crib. We did not find any problem with gaps that we read in other reviews. It was fairly easy to put together too, took an hour. Requires 2 people to assemble.
+1	We bought this crib to replace our old drop side crib and it is made really well and super sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  My favorite part is that it is low enough to the ground that I can sit on the floor and pat my daughters back with my arm through the slats.  This was an excellent purchase.
+1	Great crib, easy to put together, and very pretty. Our baby is not here yet so we haven't used the crib. For now, we like it!Sole issue: not all mattresses fit. We bought an oversize mattress and it fit with sheets and a breathable bumper -but without it the mattress moved a little bit and that freaked me out a bit (I had just taken a class of SIDS and the nurse told her that the mattress must absolutely fit snugly).So... Overall great crib but why the heck would the company not make this crib standard size??
+1	our baby loves the crib as do we.  we look forward to many years.  it is beautiful.  also bought the Emily changing table.  very good quality and matches other dark walnut wood furniture too.
+1	I bought this crib in cherry for 245$, after reading every review about this and many other cribs and safety reports.My babygril is now 4 months old. she sleeps well in it. She slept in it sinds day one.It's beautiful, very sturdy, came in perfect state..but now it has a few scrates(mostely form a belt).It's easy to setup if you just follow the instructions, my boyfriend did it on his own in about 1 hour, I sat and watched...was 37 weeks pregnant. the cherry collor is just as you see it in the picture.I still have it on the highest mattress level, because my girl cannot situp on her own yet... but sometimes I wished it had a dropside because it gets harder lifting her out of her crib all the time, she's 7 kg now.. but then a dropside is dangerous. it weigh alot, but still is very easy to move arround when you need to clean.so if you like the looks... buy it..it's worth it. good furniture.my girl is now 21 months, still sleeps very well in her crib.I still am very happy with my purches. A great crib.
+1	I would have given this product five stars, except it took almost a month to sort out a delivery snafu before we could actually get the crib together. This is the first time I've had a problem with an Amazon purchase and they weren't able to resolve it quickly (or technically, at all).The product itself seems great and it was top-rated on Consumer Reports (my main reason for ordering it). We noticed some issues with the (white) finish on one leg being scratched/stained, but since that bit faces the wall and it was such a great buy, it's not an issue for us. Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and didn't take long to put together.However, it was difficult and time-consuming to sort out problems with customer service, so I'm not 100% thrilled with the purchase.Initially, they only sent two legs (instead of four). When contacted, Amazon customer service told us we could either repack/return the entire crib (time-consuming & cumbersome) or request the missing parts from the manufacturer (Million Dollar Baby, "MDB") directly.Unfortunately, Amazon had no contact details for MDB, so we had to track it down ourselves via the MDB website. Even then, the only available contact method was via email (no phone). Once MDB responded (about a week after my first email), it took over a week to resolve, and at least another week before the parts were actually delivered.I'd hesitate before ordering another one of these products, at least until MDB improves (or expand) its customer service department.
+1	We really, really love this crib. It was easy to put together and looks GREAT in our nursery. Baby's now four months old and is loving the crib, too. Definitely recommend!
-1	I actually loved this product for the first couple months until I noticed tons of mold inside of it.  I soaked it in bleach and scrubbed it then placed it back on the faucet.  The next day I checked on it and it had already started growing mold again.  It is now in the garbage.
-1	The concept is simple, but the execution was lacking as a faucet cover.  Ok, so I purchased this product for the main purpose of deflection water so that it flowed better into a tub and second purpose to protect my child from bumping into the faucet.  This product failed in my mind on both.As a protector, it should do the job.As a water deflector, it's terrible. If you turn your water on high enough, water is deflected and sprayed in almost 270 degrees around the product. If you have a baby or toddler, your child's face will likely be bombarded with water.  The problem is with the placement design of the water deflector.  It needs to curve more so that when water hits the deflector, it's directed to flow smoothing, not splashed like when you poor water on flat surfaces.A positive is that the deflector has a tiny hole drilled so that any trapped water is drained overtime, leaving very little water to cause mildew.Another positive is that the installation is simple.  Just squeeze the top and bottom and slide into the faucet.  However, the product lacks a good snug fit design.  Therefore it slides right off with a slight pull.
+1	I have a 7 month old that before this product lean forward in her bath hitting her head on the faucet. Luckily she didn't hurt herself to badly but immediately after I jumped online to find a product that was safe in case that happened again. I love this product. It's pretty big and fit onto our faucet easily. My only complaint is that the bubble bath soap dispenser slowly leaks which can be pretty annoying.
+1	This replaced our soft toy-type faucet cover.  We don't use the bubble bath option.  But the kids think it's great to rinse under the cascading water.  No problem getting it to fit our faucet.
+1	I pre-ordered this product and waited and waited.  It was worth the wait.  My son loves the waterfall effect and it fits well on my faucet.  It is not snug and my son can take it off if he chooses but it's a small  price to pay for saftey and fun.  I do want to get the newer version of it when it comes out.Haven't used the bubble dispencer yet.
+1	It doesn't work as well as I had hoped for making bubbles for the kids, but it does "waterfall" effect the water away from the spout which is a big safety plus.
-1	I bought this knowing there is a chance I would return it and sure enough I did. It is a very cute idea and if we move/get a different faucet, I will likely try it again, but it only works if the faucet on your tub has the plug at the front of the faucet, otherwise it slides off and the water goes to the side. Just fair warning!
+1	I would actually rate this about 3.5 stars.Pros:  The white portion of the product is soft and flexible, so if your child falls into it, it's going to hurt LESS than hitting the hard metal faucet.  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt at all, just less chance of a more serious cut or injury.The water fans out in a waterfall, so your child can sit further back from the faucet and still be able to play with the water as the tub fills.Cons:  The resevoir for the bubble bath sometimes leaks, from the outlet where it's supposed to come out, but occasionally around the sides too.  Not enough leakage to make a big mess while the Boon Flo is on your faucet.  If you want to remove it for your own bathtime, however, the flip-top where you pour in the liquid has a VERY loose seal, so you have to be careful where you store the Boon Flo when not in use, as it will leak.Also, I usually only get two or 3 bubble baths out of how much liquid the resevoir holds before I have to refill it.  Maybe my brand of bubble bath doesn't suds as much as others.Overall, not bad.  My daughter loves the waterfall, but the bubble bath dispenser could be better designed.
+1	While it has not fit on every tub we've had, it works wonderfully on the ones that it does fit on.  Wish there was some sort of adaptation for varying spouts, but aside from that very happy.
-1	I loved this product in the beginning.  I bought it because I loved the water fall feature.  I left it on the spout for months and months.  It just never occurred to me to remove it.  But I happened to be cleaning something on the floor near the edge of the tub one day and I looked up and saw mildew in the Flo!  I was horrified.  I took the thing off and threw it away.  You'd think that a product that was meant for wet environments would be mildew resistant, you know, like shower curtains.
-1	I despised this stupid thing from the moment we first used it, right up until we replaced it with the Skip Hop Moby. The design, for starters, is obnoxious. The water is supposed to fountain out, which it does, but only if you've barely got the water turned on because otherwise the water pressure will pull it off the spout and it will dangle uselessly from your water diverter. You try to put it back on, but because the spout it wet, the Flo loses it's grip on the spout, slips and dangles again. OK, fine, take it off and lay it aside to be used another time. Next bath experience: you pour bubles in the top only to discover that the bubble dispenser only dispenses about 2/3rds of the bubbles, leaving 1/3rd to chill in the resevoir: not helpful, you then discover that the very act of dispensing the bubbles has caused the Flo to lose it's grip on the spout and slip down to dangle uselessly from the shower diverter. Sigh. After one or two baths, during witch you've simply poured the bubbles straight into the bath water like you've always done, and run the water very lightly which means it took approximately 15 minutes for the tub to fill up five inches, you are alarmed to see that poor Flo has developed a bad case of mildew. *Before the reader runs away with any thoughts that the author never cleans her bathroom, please be informed that said author is nearly OCD level obsessed with bathroom cleanliness, because she lives with a man, and two toddlers* This mildew simply will not cease and desist. You scrub it with high-grade noxious smelling cleansers, only to see that that mildew is going nowhere. You run the Flo through the dishwasher, no good. You soak the Flo in bleach, kinda works, but the mildew is back in force in a few days. You finally break down and order the product you should have purchased to begin with, namely, the Skip Hop Moby. The Moby does not fountain out, but then again, the Flo didn't do so well at that either. The Moby is however, very cute, has a death grip on the tub spout, and can be thoroughly cleaned. Everyone is happy in tub land once again.
+1	First the bad : we have a standard Moen tub faucet.  The Flo doesn't *quite* sit right on the faucet, so we have to play with it a bit to get all the water to go down the slope, rather than out the back of the Flo.  But it's not really a big deal, just takes a bit of adjusting.The good :  My daughter (11 months old) loves to play with the water coming from the faucet.  The Flo allows her to sit a little further back (thus sparing me stress every time she gets a little tippy!), and she also really delights in the waterfall effect.  When she gets older, I think the bubble bath dispenser will be more appreciated.Speaking of which, other reviewers have mentioned the bubble bath leaking out -- I have seen a few drops in the "scoop" under the faucet, but nothing major.  It's been on a week, and I've yet to need to refill it.I haven't had any problems with mess with this either.  Even when I didn't have it adjusted just right and water was washing backwards under the faucet, it didn't go everywhere, it just ran down the tub side (INSIDE the tub).If it wasn't for the slightly finicky adjustment necessary, I'd have given this 5 stars!
+1	I use to have the rubber duck cover on my tub faucet and hated it.  I had to cut a hole in it so I could still use the shower.  Water got trapped in the bottom and mold grew.  It was disgusting!  Then I found this product...and it is fabulous.  It easily fits on my faucet and can easily be removed for cleaning if necessary.  My daughter also loves playing with the waterfall.
-1	I almost wrote a glowing review when i first got it. it sat on the faucet fine, it protected their heads, i could use the thingamajig that makes the shower go on and off easily, and the kids loved how it spread out the water and that i could fill it will bubble bath. that was the honeymoon period...the bubble bath dispenser stopped working pretty quickly even though i tried washing it (i figured it was sticky with soap) and helping it along with my fingers while it ran, but it became more of a hassle than to just pour the bubble bath or shampoo directly in the running water.then the mildew... oh the mildew. i didn't initially take it off after every bath but noticed it was started to get a little black on the inside. so i bleached the heck out of it and then took it off and hung it to dry after every bath. it was still FULL of mildew. it was stained to the point that even though i knew it was disinfected i just couldn't use it anymore because the whole bottom was tie dyed with black mildew stains.overall since i had to buy another faucet cover anyway it was a dumb purchase.
+1	I love that this protects my LO's head from the faucet, but it's also great if you use an inflatibale tub inside your big tub (conserve water) as the extended lip makes it much easier to get water into the tub.
-1	I had soft plastic one and inflate one before. this looked good but didn't work with our faucet cause it slips off all the time since the drain hook deal is not there to keep it hold on. if it works, product looks good though.
+1	I have a weird tub (from the 1960s) where the interior is somehow diagonal. I suppose it is useful for a taller-than-average person, but it means I can not fit my baby tub flush against the front of the tub and under the faucet. So, I really like this item and the fact that it directs a lovely cascade of water into our baby bath. My son also likes to play with the cascade and one day, he may even let me wash his hair under the waterfall. I do like the bubble bath reservoir, and have used it. But the reservoir is small, so I have to refill it at just about every bath (thus, I do not use it frequently.)The only real issue with this item is that it is not made for the larger, broader faucets. Since I have a bigger faucet, The cover often shifts out of place, causing me to have to adjust it several times during the bath. However, I still like the item and find it very useful, so it's just something I have to deal with.
+1	I bought this for my son at bath time because the regular faucet doesn't reach his inflatable tub. Works great for that. Then I find out it works great for dogs. My one dog loves to drink out of the tub faucet, this makes it easier AND when I have to give the dogs a bath, it makes that easy too. Win, win and win.
+1	i love this! i have a cat that will not stay out of the tub because he loves to play with the faucet and this drives me nuts! this cover deters him from the tub and faucet! i love it! my daughter loves it so much too! she loves the waterfall effect it has. I have a larger faucet so it was awkward at first and the water was leaking out of the back of it, but after moving it around a bit and got a better grip/seal on the faucet with it, it works just fine now! easy clean up too. just soak in in bleach a little but when i clean up her other bath toys and it's good as new. I don't have issues with nasty mildew with mine as other's have reported in their reviews. i never have to remove it unless i'm cleaning it. it's great and never in the way and looks great in my bathroom.
+1	We just started having bath time in the tub with our 7 month year old baby and he is just mesmerized by it.  Can't wait for him to grow up so we can start the bubble baths!!
-1	If you have a shorter faucet, don't buy this item. It won't work properly, and the water will just spew out the side of it all over the floor.
+1	When we first tried to bathe our infant in the &#34;big girl tub,&#34; she was terrified and cried so hard! A friend suggested we try the boon flo water deflector, and ever since she has loved them! It slows the flow of water and even helps it not sound so loud. Our tub only has 1 water control, so in order for it to be warm water it has to be a higher flow. With this handy little device she now loves playing in the water as it falls out. Totally worth the money spent!
+1	I have a newly remobled bathroom and we went with the big fat faucet spout this sharp looking modern designed cover doesn't even go all the way over it. But if you have an average size faucet it would be great!
+1	I bought this product because I loved the look of it and needed a faucet cover since we are having a baby in just a few days. I thought the ducky and frog covers were bit tacky. As soon as I got home with this, I opened it up and stuck in on the faucet and filled it with bubbles. I love the waterfall and took a bath that night. I was having issues with the bubble dispense when I first put in super thick bubble bath. I then mixed the thick bubble bath with runnier bubble and it worked great. I do wish the bubble dispense worked a bit better as I am not 100% satisfied with it but still love it. It also does not slip off our faucet like some reviewers have complained about.
-1	I purchased it to protect my 1YO twins from hitting their heads.I loved how it directs the flow of the water.However, shortly after using it I removed it to clean it and there was mold everywhere. I used bleach, tile cleaner and nothing works. The mold is embedded in the plastic.I recently had a vent fan installed in my bathroom and I have a open window (used it in summer warm weather) No where else in my bathroom has mold or moisture issues so teh problem is with the product.
-1	I really wanted to like this product and thought it was really cute; however water tends to pool in the water deflector which creates mildew.  In addition, the mildew stains won't clean off at all.  I have even tried applying bleach products, and the material remains stained from the mildew.  There is a small hole in the water deflector to allow for water to drain; however I have found that this hold gets plugged and requires a toothpick to clean it.  The water deflector does deflect water to some degree, but it certainly does not create a "waterfall" as shown in the pictures.  If the waterfall worked properly, it would be a lot more fun.  The bubble dispenser seemed like a nice idea; however we ended up liking a bubble bath that requires the product to be shaken before dispensing, so the bubble dispenser didn't meet our needs.
+1	My 14 month old loves playing with it - especially the part about placing the different shapes on the surrounding walls of the tub. I strongly recommend this product.
+1	our son loves sticking the forms on the wall of the bathtub.  and they stay in place for quite some time!  When he was little he also chewed them and they still worked. the colors did not fade after almost a year of use.  and he still enjoys them (very few toys have captured his attention for such a long time)
+1	Like another reviewer, I picked these up for only $8 at TJ Maxx. They have been selling tons of Boon products lately, which is great! My daughter loved these immediately. The pieces are a good size, interesting "blob" shapes, and cool colors (includes brown, teal, mustard, etc. in addition to your typical baby primaries). She loves standing up in the bath now (eek!) and sticking these to the wall. They stay on well with very little pressure and water. She has been chewing on them too, and has yet to tear one, so they seem quite durable. They show some teeth marks, but that's it. The scrubbies are a little rough to actually wash a baby with (stick to a washcloth), but they are another tactile item to explore. The balls in the new sets (shiny vs. matte) are PVC-free, and daughter also loves chewing on those. So does the dog for that matter, she's gotten a hold of and destroyed two! Overall, I'd highly recommend them, but try to find them on sale :)
+1	Prior to purchasing these toys, we had a tough time getting my 8 month old son to enjoy bath time. It would take two of us to get the job done and he'd whine the whole time. At my wits end, I decided to look into getting him some safe toys for bath time.Here's what I like about these toys.BRIGHT AND MODERN. They are simple, bright, and modern shapes that definitely attract my sons attention. He especially loves the silicone balls.SIMPLE AND COMPACT. These toys are a great alternative to classic bath toys that tend to take up a great deal of space. When I was searching for toys, all I could really find were large boats and rubber duckies. Those would of all taken up a large amount of space in our already too crowded bathroom. The flat shapes just stay stuck to our walls in between bath time and the balls go in a little basket in the shower.SAFE AND BPA FREE. These little guys don't absorb water so they are less likely to get mold and mildew (we have yet to spot any on the toys). They are BPA, PVC, and phthalate-free.SCRUBBIES. The scrubbies that are included with the toys are the perfect size for little bodies. It fits in the palm of my hand and I just squirt a little bit of soap into it and I get the job done.I'm glad I found these toys because my son now loves bath time. They fit in his little hands nicely and the keep him entertained. When he gets older, I am certain he will still love them because he will be able to learn colors as well as paste them onto the shower walls himself.
+1	My baby has loved these.  He seems to enjoy the variety of shapes and colors.  I love that they don't have little holes in them to collect water and mold.  They will be easy to keep clean and they are easy for him to grip and play with.
+1	We got these for my son's second birthday, and he adores them. He has learned all their names, and loves to play with them in the bath. He doesn't quite have the hang of how to fill them up yet, but he is great at squirting them! The surprising thing is that my 9-year-old likes them too.
-1	Please be careful.  I ordered this item, my Grandson just arrived and I got them out.  I never thought that they would give me duplicates of animals.  It shows the animals you get and I got two of the hippo and no cow.  Of course, at home his cow is his favorite and well as the Penquin as they are black and white.  He identied with them early and the black and white contrast for infants is really important.  Good lesson - don't just make sure you got it or it works, look for duplicates and same colors.  A real disappointment.
-1	My 14 month old likes these but they are unsanitary. No matter how well I empty them of water after each bath they still grow mold inside them. You go to squirt them and black gunk comes out. I'm going to get rid of these and find other bath toys that are easier to keep clean
+1	I bought these for my 6 month old who loves the bath and she loves these toys.
+1	Very nice my baby girl love's them nice size for baby and safe for baby to play with toxic free love it.
+1	Got these for my 8 month old. She likes them but not as much as the rubber ducky and the water cups. A good buy.
+1	We received this as a gift at my baby shower and I was eager to use them. We first brought them out when my daughter was about 5 months old and she loves them! We still use them during bathtime (she is almost 11 months) and also have a few out on her play area since she likes chewing on them. She giggles when I squirt her with them and likes the bright colors. Good product for a reasonable price - highly recommended.
+1	My baby loves bath time with these toys. Great quality and great price. Just make sure to fully dry the toys so mold dosen't build up in them.
+1	gave as a baby gift. well received. really fun grouping. wish I had gotten one for my baby too! LOL
+1	Needless to say, I bought this as a gag pacie! My daughter and son-in-law just moved to his home town in Mississippi before having first baby. I saw this and got a big kick out of it!! It is a great pacie and looks crazy cute in baby's mouth. I am ordering another for my other daughter in Tennessee!!
+1	I really don't know why exactly I am attracted to these things... but I think they are fun and look hysterical. Although if the baby is very young this brand tends to be on the heavy side and the baby may not be able to use it.
+1	fun toy
+1	Not wanting to travel with my toddler's Britax, I ordered this as a safe and easy to transport seat when I go visit friends or relatives that involve a flight.  (trying to rustle up the right sized car seats at the destination is stressful).  We didn't need the seat for the airline seat (yet), but I liked the fact that this was purported to be FAA compliant and would fit into a regular airline seat.  The seat is a nice size, very sturdy due to a steel frame.  My daughter liked it.  Imagine a Britax without the plastic base.  What I found challenging was the weight and dimensions.  Although it does "fold" (the seat into the back), it is still pretty bulky and 25 lbs of dead weight heavy.  The price seems high at first for a travel car seat, but upon receipt, you'll see that it is a durable piece of equipment.  Since it goes up to 80 lbs, I anticipate having many years of use with it and intend on using it as my daughter's "booster" when she gets older.
+1	My husband and I have an older car that does not have the latch system for car seats.  So any car seat we buy had to be strapped in using the belts.  When we first bought this seat car seat we thought it was a bit difficult to install, but not hard.  Now, after installing a different (supposedly comparable) car seat in my parents car, I think we have an incredibly easy car seat to install!  The directions for installation are clear and comprehensible.  the few times we moved the car seat to a rental or my parents car and utilized the latch system I couldn't believe how much easier it was than the latch system we bought for my parents car, thread through the bottom and snap in the latches... you're done!  I also researched safety  reviews and the Radian went beyond the requirements for safety - SOLD.  It is quite heavy, but since it folds up and tucks away into a duffle bag or duffle/backpack - it's easier to travel with.
+1	We got one of these for my older daughters and I love the whole thing. The infant body support converts into a very good head support for older children, it's low to the seat so I can get them in and out easier with  other car seats and I can fit 2 Radians and a Graco Snugride 32 in the back of our little 2 door Sunfire.
+1	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  Both were huge and bulky.  When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!The Sunshine Radian is different!  It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  And a SNUG FIT!  Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!
+1	The body support is great, however our daughter's head never stayed properly in place even with both this support & the car seat's head support cushion. We ended up getting a completely different head support that actually worked.
+1	I liked the body rest but not the head reast...Read washing instructions...The body rest is very soft and comfortable...Nice color.
+1	I got this so I could put my son in the Bob stroller without using a car seat.  At 5 weeks it worked great - he was cozy and snuggled and very well supported.  I compared this to the snuzzler in the store and IMO this one was much thicker and more supportive.  In the store the price was about the same between the two so I went with this one.  Love it!
+1	I love this highchair. I have a larger 13 month old (27lbs!) and it really fit him very well. I tried all types of highchairs and they were not fitting him. I literally took him to Babies R Us and sat him in every chair they have- nothing was suiting him. Additionally, this highchair was EASY EASY to put together- just a few min and all done! It did not have the typical cheap parts that most highchairs have. Being my 3rd baby, I really appreciated how easy this is to clean. With the materials used, it should remain looking brand new (no fabric to machine wash and fade over time). Im thrilled with the look and how little space it takes up. It rolls around like a dream on my hardwoods (not made for carpet). I HIGHLY suggest this chair. As he grows, I can easily roll him up to the kitchen table without using the removable tray. And... the look is very easy on the eyes!Charleston Mom, SC
+1	Bought for my baby when he turned 10 months and started feeding himself and making a royal mess everywhere.  He hated his old standard plastic high chair (graco, typical type) from day 1.  He now seems MUCH more comfortable in this Boon Flair, and it's so easy to clean (over and over and over and over), very few nooks and crannies to gunk up, and it works easily into our small kitchen lives, and he is able to sit more upright like a real chair and it fits right up to our table.  He's much more a "part" of our family meals now than when he was in the monstrous plastic graco we had before.  Before buying the Boon Flair I did briefly consider the Stokke because I liked the idea of pulling my kid straight up to the table-- however Stokke is WAY more $ and online videos of kids tipping themselves over freaked me and that was the end of that.  But it turns out that this Boon Flair chair works great, in my book, to get my kid right up to the table -- the adjustable height makes it easy to either position him to fit with the table, with or without his tray.  I also love the ease of washing, drip drying, and storing the much smaller tray and tray liners.  Some people don't like the small size, I totally love it vs. the monstrous plastic graco tray we had before.One note on the sleek modern design, too, because I was nervous about this element because I am not a real "modern design" person at all, and we have kind of a "country kitchen" with copper and gold tones and a bunch of plants and a 1980s style cheesy wooden dining set...but I feel this modern style high chair is just a nice clean look, in general, it blends in fine and it looks WAY better then the classic plastic monstrosity we had before.Here are my few minor annoyances, every product has some and I find it helpful to read other people's reviews that list the bad along with the good so I can sort out what the dealbreakers for me would be.  None of these, for me, are a big deal obviously since I gave this product 5 stars, but in an ideal world, these elements would be better:  1) the lap belt clip closure sort of jams up right where the tray/t-bar all come together with baby's belly, so I feel like I have to manuever it around to get it comfie for my guy, plus its so snugged up at that particular point it's nearly impossible to unsnap the tray liner off the base tray while baby is in the chair too.  2) the pneumatic adjustment still takes a bit of manual force to get it up/down.  Nothing herculean, but I did think it would only take a light tap to the orange button to adjust, and that is not the case. 3) the tray removal mechanism is a little bit of a "thing" to get the hang of, and I still have to think about what I'm doing to get it to latch/unlatch 4) the base tray (which is NOT dishwasher safe, although I personally don't care about that) has some open spaces related to the latch mechanism -- this just means that after washing it you need to fully turn it on end and drain it so you don't accidentally dump dishwater all over your baby when you put the tray over him next time.There are a few baby products that I have felt have been worth every penny -- My Ergo, babyjogger city elite stroller, fuzzibunz perfect size diapers, and this high chair!  5 stars :)
+1	This high chair has an edge and really is convenient to clean spilled food.  My only complaints would be that the seat doesn't rotate around the base so you have to lift the whole chair if you want to switch the facing position of your infant.  The base is kind of heavy for that purpose.  Still a great, great product.
+1	I bought this for my 6-month-old daughter (she is in the 50th percentile for height and weight). The chair came in a HUGE box and was very easy to assemble--it was basically 3 pieces you insert one into the other and then attach 8 bolts. It took me less than 10 minutes by myself. I am 5'7 and it comes almost high enough that I could stand and feed her comfortably (but not quite...I wish it came up another 6 inches but then it'd probably be unstable). I have Pergo floors and was able to roll it around easily. I didn't expect the brake to work after reading all the other reviews, maybe they've fixed it because it doesn't budge when the brake is engaged, even when my daughter rocks around. I went with the orange seat pad after reading about spaghetti and carrot stains, so far it still looks new. I highly recommend the orange! The pneumatic lift is fun, it does make the chair heavy but I don't plan on lifting it. The tray snaps in and out with one hand easily (they must have updated this since the older reviews too). It is smaller than other high chairs but seems big enough so far. The plastic covers are great--one is covered with a huge sticker when it arrives, and doesn't come off easily. I used a blow drier, though, and it came off without leaving residue. Boon should really think about doing something other than a sticker there...we already bought the chair, we don't need the advertising! The reason I give it 4 stars is the harness system doesn't fit my daughter well. I made it as tight as it could go, but it's still VERY loose over her shoulders. However, this isn't a carseat, it's a highchair. Maybe it doesn't have to be so snug. It would make me feel better though. Once the tray is in I don't see how she could fall out. Finally, the chair looks great in our house and we get compliments on it. I'm actually proud of the high chair! I love that it will hold her up to 50lbs and is so easy to clean. I would recommend this to my friends.
+1	I know that's a little corny, but it's true!  Great binding! I love the options for the title on the spine.  Holds all landscape pictures, so I trim my favorite portrait pics into squares.  Nice and easy album!
+1	Very happy with this album, it is cute, and very sturdy. The front picture and binding picture are also a nice touch for organization
+1	I love this album.  Bought 2 for two different sets of great grandparents.  I filled it out with our baby's photos from the first few months of her life and am printing off more 4x6 photos as she grows that I mail to them for them to add to the album.I LOVE the side photo frame and title block.
+1	Great photo book. I'll be ordering more of these as a  new mom taking WAY too many pictures of my little girl! Love the windows on the outside and the personalization options. Doesn't look cheap and well made.
+1	I love this photo album since you can put the photo in front and on the side. Plus its simplicity makes it really nice. Will buy more of this!
+1	I purchased this photo book to use as a documentation of my baby's first year of life.  There are tabs to write next to the photos and this was perfect for me.  It is a very high quality product and I love the side picture on the binding.  I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.  I HIGHLY recommend this for parents and grandparents especially.
+1	This is cute.  The foot stamp is difficult to use but at least the baby stays clean.  Overall nice amount of pages.
+1	It's bit pricey but I love it. I can do light scrapbooking while adding family history and little antedotes about me and my husband for our son. I recommend this photobook.
+1	This is a great book for people who want a nice, normal baby book, without tons of cutesy things.  You can add stamps/crafts/stickers/etc to get a similar look, as I did on a few pages.  I also like that each page is removable, so you can reorder things, remove pages you don't need, etc.  We decided to use the many picture pages with lines on the side for a monthly picture and things that happened that month.  Much easier to rearrange as we'd like to do this and not need the firsts pages.  For pages I didn't use, I put craft paper over them to cover the headings and made it something else.I also like how they have a variety of other books, so I bought a similar book but different cover for my 2nd one.
+1	I love this baby book!  I love the fact you can put your own baby's foot/hand print on the cover (there is also a page for more feet or hand prints!)  It has all the fill in the blanks you will need: baby's family tree, parents' info, pop culture, news headlines, prices of things, miletones, growth chart etc... the only thing it does not have are envelopes for keepsakes.  I made my own envelope page for the 1st haircut, and then just taped things in the book.  I taped the hosptial bracelets on the inside cover and greeting cards throughout the book.It's just so pretty and presentable.  I even bought one for my friend's babyshower!
-1	I didn't care for this book. It just seemed like a lot of extra work with the photo corners that you need to put on each picture. I have 3 kids and work full-time and I just don't have that kind of time. I wanted to return it - the company gave me the run around for a week and then told me it was too late to return it ( had been 29 days and they allow only 30 - including shipping time). Finally, was able to return it and theY took a percentage off for restocking ! Would NOT buy from this seller again!
+1	This baby book would appeal to those with a more modern or minimalist taste.  It does not contain cutesy pictures, rather allows you to place your own cute baby pictures in it.  All the pages are a solid cream color.  The left page is for the pictures, which are self-applied with the provided photo corners.  Therefore, you can put virtually any size pictures.  The page on the right cover a different topic.  Some of these include one for mom, where you can put your name birthdate, places you've lived, schools you attended, hobbbies.  There is one for daddy.  There is a page for how mommy and daddy met.  One page is about how you found out you were pregnant.  There is a place to write when or if you found out the gender of the baby, and how you felt.  There is one for the baby shower.  There's a page for the baby's family tree up to his/her great grandparents.  One page is for the day baby is born.  There is a page for baby's firsts.  There are spots for birthdays for the first few years.  I'm not sure what it would take for me to give it all five stars, but it just didn't make me flip with excitement. Overall I'm completely satisfied with the book and it suits my needs.
+1	I haven't used our book yet, but it is made of quality material, and I like that you can remove/re-arrange pages to fit your needs. The inkpad appears easy to use as well. Very good buy!
+1	I love to scrapbook but decided to go with something a little more structured than just a blank book for our baby book. I was leery of this one because it didn't give a good description of what the pages inside had on them. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety though and the fact that you can add or remove pages as desired.Some of the pages include "how mommy and daddy met" "mommy and daddy's wedding day" "the first time we heard your heartbeat" "doctor visits" "the day you were born" " our family tree" then continues on with pages for each birthday up to 5 years and first Christmas first Easter first Halloween etc... Most pages the left side of the book is blank for pictures and the right has headings and lines you can write on.For any headings that I didn't know what to write or didn't want to write about I just put pictures on both pages and covered up the heading. (Only did this twice)Then the last several pages are just full of photo slots like a regular photo album and each slot has a space next to it where you can write something short about the picture.So long and short I think this is a great book! Have not tried out the ink for foot/handprints yet but it looks simple enough. I like that its a no mess process.
-1	I bought this hat for my baby and did not find it to be a good product.  It was too thick and did not have any give to get it on my baby's head!
+1	this hat is adorable and keeps my baby warm. I read other reviews that included issues with the elastic. My baby's head is a normal size, and the hat fits her perfectly at two months. It was too big and covered her eyes at one month old. So far it has been great during these colder months.
-1	this product it is ok, but from 6 months and up.cover until my newborn neck.material and quality are ok.
+1	This is the cutest hat ever! I am going to buy the larger size for this winter possibly ( if they have one for one year olds). I will say that he definitely wouldn't have been able to wear by the time he was 4 months though. It took us through the winter ( he is a January baby). So I would definitely suggest it for a winter newborn. Older babies should definitely get the size up or cut the lining maybe as someone else suggested.
+1	This hat is super cute! I was hoping this would fit my newborn, as she was born in cold december in Maine, but it is WAY to big for my newborn's head. However, the quality is excellent and this hat is super warm and will hold up very well, I can tell already. I washed and dried it, and it doesn't appear that it shrunk the hat at all. Great quality, I recommend it!
-1	Couldn't use this because even the 0-6 is gigantic. Ended up donating it to Goodwill because our baby's head didn't fit into it until it was too warm to wear.
-1	This hat is, to put it plainly, horrible.  My baby is 8 weeks old and his head is in the 25th percentile for circumference and my husband and I had to struggle to even get it on his head.  Once we did have it on, sort of, we had to pull  it down to his nose to fill it out.  Needless to say we aren't keeping it.
+1	I bought this for my three-month-old granddaughter and it doesn't fit.  It says it's for 0-6 months, but no way.  It also has no 'give' to stretch.  It is a tightly fitted cap.  Too bad, because it is adorable.
+1	Wanted a cute, warm hat for winter - this is it!  It's a little big now but by the time it gets really cold, it should be perfect!  Great price too!
-1	This hat is appropriate for a 3 month to 6 month child.  It would be too tight for an older child, would be better if band around head was elastic or more flexible.
+1	Bought this for my new grandson. He is two days old and is wearing it for his trip home from the hospital. It is soft and snuggy warm
-1	It doesn't fit my 5 month old and I ordered the 6-12 month size...cute but I guess I will pass it on to a friend with a newborn because it's not worth shipping back.
-1	This hat was just way too small.  My daughter does have a large head, but I ordered this when she was 5 months old and it was too tight.
+1	MY BABY IS WARM WITH HER HAT AND IT'S CUTE IF I KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE TO SIZE I'LL ORDER 6 MONTH INSTED OF 3 MONTHS OTHERWISE I JUST LOVE IT
-1	Bought it for my baby girl when she was 3 mth only and couldn't fit into it all eventhough it clearly notes for 0-6mth.The hat looks nice on picture but since it is not stretchy, it is not accommodating at all.
+1	My son loves these little colorful boats. Not only does he like chasing them around in the bathtub, he also likes playing with them outside of the tub. They are soft enough for him to use to chew on.
+1	These are nice bath toys. They float reliably and are colorful and engaging for my 6 month old daughter. I've also started using them at mealtime- she plays with them rather than trying to grab the spoon, then they either wash off super easy or go in the tub with her.
+1	My son is a toddler and he LOVES these. They are part of bath time every night. Once we forgot to put them in the tub and he was not happy till we gave them to him.
+1	These are cute boats for the bath. Like all bath toys, after about 3 months they are starting to get moldy on the inside. Happens to all bath toys so I knew that when I bought them.
+1	Excellent and colourful and makes bath time fun.
+1	I purchased these tubby toys for my grandson, he loves to play in the tub.  And the fact that they squirt is wonderful.  I can't wait until his next bath!! Amazon keep up the great work with wonderful selections!!
+1	These little boats have turned out to be a good purchase with our grandchildren for both bath time and pool time. They are colorful and cute, and the variety makes for good play time.
+1	What can i say, they loved playing with them. Until my dogs chewed them to pieces. But they're great for some water fun for the kids.
+1	If you want a soft-hanging organizer, this is the best you'll get. It does tip forward a bit, as any hanging fabric organizer will, but it has compensated for that with pocketed shelves (as opposed to open shelves like on theDex Products Ultimate Baby Organizerwhere everything slides right off). I use this Munchkin organizer with thePrince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmerand it fits great right on top in a very convenient place. It fits everything I need in the organizer, whereas with theDex OrganizerI had to use an extra TV table tray to handle the overflow. The pocketed diaper middle section is great! It actually holds the diapers in! It's tricky to "restock" it, but the fact that the diapers do not tip out more than makes up for it! If you want something sturdier, you'll have to go with hard plastic, because you won't find a better fabric organizer.
+1	We really like this item because it keeps a bit of everything you need for baby within arms reach. Sturdy and easy to use.
-1	Ended up returning this product without using it because it ended up being 'deeper' than I thought it would be. Thought it would hold diapers a different way but the way it's designed didn't allow me to put it where I intended. I'm sure it's a great product ... but I would recommend looking at the dimensions before ordering.
+1	Easy to use and stores are your changing table essentials! Can only about 50 diapers in the side which is so great!
+1	It was just as described.... I liked a lot, it's very usefull and the compartiments have plenty of space to organize things!
-1	This thing annoys me so much.  I came on Amazon to find a different brand.  The velcro is incredibly weak.  I can not fill the thing up with diapers b/c it can't handle the weight.  It is very sloppy looking.  It's made of fabric and sags all over.  This thing looks nothing like the picture.  I do not recommend.
-1	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic "Diaper Depot" by Prince Lionheart.
-1	Love the idea but it just doesn't work quite as well as the pictures say.  The thing sags so much in the shelf/pockets that stuff falls off...even with the plastic supports inserted.  The velcro fasteners don't have enough grip to stay attached, so nails are really the only option and I didn't want to nail this stupid thing into the side of my convertible changing table.
+1	i haven't really used this as yet because i haven't gotten her crib as yet and im using her play yards organizer but i buy her pampers in bulk so i use all the sections to store her pampers and so far i love it it sages a bit but thats ok i dont mind nothing falls out so its great.
+1	This diaper organizer has a ton of space for diapers and other changing essentials.  It conveniently attaches to the crib or door.  I love the color and elegant look!
-1	I put this on my registry, but after setting it up on our changing table, I realized it was not what I wanted.  It's much larger than I thought from the picture.  It took up a lot of space, and I didn't have enough misc. items to fill it up.  Everything was sagging.  I tried to put wipes at the top, but they just slid to the front.  We folded it up after a month and haven't tried to use it since.
+1	When you are changhing a baby you need a lot of things. With this helpfull products, you do not take the risk of leave your chid unattended to reach somethig .I would preffer a more colored material, so it would not be so delicatte.For moms , time  is very important . If they have to wash frecuenttly this garments, it is not very convenient, and it would not last very much .Please use some other colors. I would preffer better not solid color. Something with animals or baby atractive stuff, that will like to watch for the baby while you change him or her.
-1	I bought this in a store, and the whole thing caved inward wherever you put more than a few ounces of weight. Don't waste your time or money. There's no way it could ever hold half of the stuff it shows in the stock image.
+1	It's a useful thing to have while traveling, but doesn't have enough volume for regular use.  If you really want to make your own baby food a real food processor is a must, this isn't efficient enough for daily use.
-1	I originally got this because of its simplicity and the price.  I found, though, that it doesn't do a very good job of getting the food "mushy" enough, even with the food steamed.  I gave my daughter some of the mash and she was spitting out bits of un-ground food.I will be looking for something that purees the food a bit more.
-1	We could not get this to work properly. We tried over and over, following the instructions provided. The grate kept popping out, the food that did get ground up was still too coarse for our child to eat. The juices from the food also ran everywhere, even with the silicone around the plunger. It was also very hard to clean and reassemble.
+1	This food grinder works just fine.  It is a little messy when trying to load some looser foods.  I use it on a weekly basis and I have never had any trouble with it.  Be sue and rinse it immediately after use so that no food gets stuck down in it!  Learned that the hard way!
+1	I'm totally neurotic about my baby choking on food, so I bought this food mill to mash up soft foods more uniformly than I could do with a fork. I use it primarily for bananas, blueberries, and avocados. It's simple and easy to use. I would not use this as my primary means of grinding up baby food- I use my Cuisinart for that, but for quick simple things, this works great.
+1	These snack containers work well as, well snack containers...but don't think they will keep the snack from spilling or going all over the car.  It takes about 5 minutes for a toddler to figure out how to make them through cereal all over the place. LOL!  I had high hopes the cereal would be contained...but no.
+1	We use this on all of our outings with our 18 month old.  I love the no spill an ease of use for my little one.
-1	The flaps are too rigid and hurt the fingers when pulling out. Wish they could have used a softer material. I did not give this to my son.
+1	This is a wonderful product for toddlers and preschoolers who like to have snacks on the go (or just away from the table). I love the silicone top because it's very flexible, but always goes back to it's original shape. The handles are just right for little hands too. Kids who are determined to spill their food will not be deterred by this cup. For children' beyond that stage, it's so much better than an open bowl (inevitably overturned) or a baggie (disposable, creates trash, also easy to spill).My only tiny complaint is that the plastic of the base scratches pretty easily, so mine doesn't look as clean as it did when we began using it several months ago. Also, the slightly indented bottom doesn't drain cleanly in the dish rack, but it's a small price to pay for the skid-resistant base. The rubbery plastic has held up well, but we don't put ours in the dishwasher.
+1	The teeth of the lid easily fold on themselves. You don't have to worry about your child's hand getting caught in this. Since I wondered about this when I was purchasing, I just want to post that fact. The packaging also says the product is BPA free--good to know.
+1	I love these snack traps and have been using them since my son was at least 12 months, if not sooner.  I wish they made lids for them, but I use a daisy sour cream lid and it fits well.  Combine it with a paci grip to keep it from landing on the floor when he is in his stroller and it is perfect.
-1	I returned these snack cups because I didn't like the lids. I bought these for my son when he was 11 months old, and I thought the plastic was a bit rough for his hands. I found another snack cup with a fabric opening that I liked better.
+1	Containers are fine, just wish that the color combinations were more extensive. I would have liked a &#34;pink&#34; and an &#34;orange&#34; or &#34;yellow&#34; but that wasn't available.
+1	These snack cups are a life saver.  Our little guy can have his snack walking around, riding in the car, or romping around outside and there is a 100% guarantee of no spills!  Yahoo!
+1	My first child, I LOVED these. They were wonderful, and I stocked up on them. He never spilled his food with these, and I didn't have to worry about him spilling cheerios, cereals, crackers, etc. everywhere. I had read someone's reviews after that complaining about their kids pulling the top off, I rolled my eyes because my kid never did it! Well, along came baby #2. From when I first gave them to him (at 10 months old) he would use his teeth to pull the top off, defeating the whole purpose. So now, that child which is now 18m can't use them as he makes a mess... my 4 year old still uses these, and still has yet to try to take the top off, so I love them for him.EDIT: I did try other brands I found in chain stores, and of the few I tried, Munchkins are the best for little hands IMO. The rubber is soft and pliable, while still doing the job. Another brand makes sharp hard plastic points to get into, and I threw those away.
+1	These are a great product.  Yes, kids can figure out how to spill the snack out of the cup if they want to, but it helps avoid many accidental spills.  My son likes to shake the cup up and down with his goldfish inside and nothing escapes.  These are an everyday staple in our house.
+1	I have long been a fan of the (more expensive) Snap Traps, so I was glad to come across this version.  These aren't only great for keeping spills off the floor at home, but I would also attach them to the stroller, car seat, shopping seat cover, etc for snacks when we're out and about.
+1	I bought these to entertain my 16 month old daughter with breakfast snacks while we commute in the AM (long commute).  They work perfectly for that but....the top has enough give that she can shake the container upside down and toss snacks all over the back seat (cheerios, etc.).  Other than that - love them.
+1	These snack traps (as we call them) are great for my 1 year old puttering around the house after his second dinner.  We put cheerios, fruit, etc in them and they don't fall out.  My son has thrown them across hardwood floors and the lid stays on!
+1	These hold up pretty well, but the lid can be pulled off by a small child with some work. Good price though, so it was worth it to me.
-1	the plastic on the top of this snack catcher is not good quality.  We used it once and a piece plastic from the top tore off; a major choke hazard.  Save your time and money, I won't be surprised to hear this product is recalled in the near future...  For a better option try the "snack trap", we used ours for 3 years not and no issues with the product breaking down.
+1	I love these cups!! Great for toddlers. Makes my little one feel very independent. I use it at home and in the car. Great for taking snacks to grandmas house, too.
+1	My baby is 6m and he did not know how to grab puffs from the cup. He may learn it later. The design is nice and no food drop out. A good container for babies!
+1	This product really works well for my 10 month old. It keeps her snacks inside without spilling out everywhere. She was a little confused on how to get her hand in and pull the snacks out, but once she realized there was food in it she caught on real quick. I'm satisfied with this purchase.
+1	They are as I expected and described. Not much more to say about a product that holds snacks for kids.
+1	Love these snack cups! There are less messes for me to clean up after introducing these to my son.  His snacks do not come out at all when it is turned upside down (Maybe some crumbs get through). I've used this with cereal,  cut up fruit, pretzels.  They're great.
+1	Awesome idea!! We love these snack cups. The lid is made of soft silicone and allows for your little one to reach in and grab a snack but not dump them out when they decide to dance and shake it.Great product! Super glad my sister in law got these for us and I will definitely pass them on to all the mom to be's I know!
+1	I wish I found these sooner. I had such a hard time getting my boy to keep his little cereal and snacks in the little glad container. No more problems with this at all. Granted, he will stick his fingers in the cup and turn it upside down, but that happens so rarely it doesn't bother me. He learned very quickly to stick his little hand in there and get the snacks.Awesome product!
+1	Even if the lids are a bit stiff, they stay on and do their job. Better than the cute Nuby one, sadly.
+1	My kids are both snackers and this has a been a great investment for all of our little snacks.The only one we ever have problems with are cheerios. They are so small and sometimes extra ones will slip out.My kids have done great with them though, so I haven't ever had issues with the lid or anything. It stays put and the kids grab their snacks.Great for trips to the store, and car rides!
+1	I love munchkin brand. They come up with some great ideas. These work wonderfully. It took my 2yr old a couple tries to figure this out but she quickly picked up on it and it is working wonderfully for us
-1	I love the idea of these but the execution is terrible. We have tried everything to keep the lid on and nothing at all works. We're going back to the clunkier one we have that's a little more difficult to get the snacks out of, but the bonus is that the lid stays put. And that we don't have quite as much spillage.
+1	I previously used another snack cup and when it was time to get more I gave these a try.  I LOVE these way better than other ones I've tried. The "flaps" on these are rounded so they dont hurt little hands when getting snacks out. They are larger than other snack cups which allow you to add a little or a lot.  Also great for bulkier items like orange wedges and strawberries.  I have even used these to carry dry cereal in and then we remove the lid add milk and the kids eat out of them for traveling on the road.  The lids snap on pretty tight and I havent had a problem with my child removing them like others that easily slipped off.  The colors are nice and the clear container allows me to see which snack is inside or the amt. left.  They clean up easily in the dishwasher or by hand.  The bottom of the cup part as a rubberized band that helps the cup from slipping easily on say a table.  the handles also have this same rubberized texture on them.  The handles are closed loop which I added links to to secure them to the stroller.  I have found that snacks do stay fresh for at least 2 days after that your pushing it.  Very happy we found these and are a must buy for baby showers!
+1	I love these cups.  I have purchased some very expensive snack cups but I reach for these most often.  I would say that the only downside is now that my daughter has figured out the system, she can easily separate the lid from the container.  This has resulted in a mess quite a few times but prior to her figuring that out they worked great.  Also dishwasher safe, which is huge.
+1	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.
-1	Forget it.  The first time my 16 month used the cup she stuck her entire hand in it and pulled up really fast and all of her snack went flying.  Note - I maybe filled it a 1/4 of the way.  I tried again thinking she'll realize what she did, which she did, but now she just pushes the top in until everything falls out.  Great concept, but just too big to work.  Maybe for older kids it may work?
+1	These are the coolest things you could possibly have if you child is already snacking on goldfish, cereal, grapes or anything small like that. they can grab and hold their own food without you having to worry about picking up a mess later. there's no lid that you have to remove, unlike what i used to have to remove when i carried my sons snacks around. they're ready to go! these are especially great for the car. with my son my car is a disaster from all the little things he used to eat and then drop. this is no longer an issue with this. although my son is a little thinker and loves to figure out how things work, so when he's bored he'll get fancy and make a small mess, but as long as your kid is hungry and isn't too worried about how this little cup is supplying their food, no worries for you. i especially like these ones compared to another brand, "snack trap" i believe, these are see through, and i think they look a lot better. i like the way the plastic feels also.all in all, get these!!! eliminate messes everywhere you go! why NOT get them?
+1	But of course, there will come a time when you spot your baby open the lid and spill the contents all over the floor.  :)
+1	Bought these as a snack cup for my daughter. They work great for most snacks. We've had goldfish crackers, Gerber Graduates Puffs, cheez-its, and even animal crackers in these. They just don't work so well for cheerios.The silicone lids stay on reasonably well and are easy for children to reach their hands through and soft for sensitive baby skin. They won't stay on if you kids waves them about really wildly, but stay on better than I had expectedThe one draw back is that the fins of the lids don't completely touch leaving a very small opening. This is fine for most snacks, but cheerios are small enough to slip through with just a little shaking. Otherwise they work as intended and are great for snacking when the kid is on the move; especially in the stroller.
-1	I can't remember how old our daughter was when we got some of these for her snacks. Maybe 9 months. But within minutes she learned she could push into it along the edges, flip it upside down, and shake all the contents out onto the floor or wherever she was. We may as well have given the snacks to her in a cup without a lid.My wife picked up a Munchie Mug (Munchie Mug - The New Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Made in the USA. - BPA Free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top) and this one did the trick! Our daughter can reach her hand into it and pull out a piece of snack or two, but she can't empty the entire contents. Yes, it costs more, but I'm willing to pay more for superior products that actually get the job done.We will still use these Munchkin ones on occasion when the other snack mug is dirty or we can't find it, but we always use them reluctantly. Save yourself a lot of hassle and get the Munchie Mug instead
+1	I really like these snack catchers!  A friend of mine had them and suggested that I get them.  I was tentative because I wasn't sure whether I really needed another toddler thing and we had been using normal containers and just having our son come to us when he wanted a few cheerios.  Well, I decided that I would give them a shot and I'm so glad I did!  It took a little while for my son to figure it out but once he did, he loved it and it has made the whole snack thing SO much easier.  I can limit how much I put in there and he knows that he only gets whatever is in the catcher.  No more finding cheerios all over the house because they don't fall out.  I have heard of kids figuring out how to get the cheerios to dump out but I guess my kid cares more about eating them than playing with the container because we haven't had any issues.  I think it would be neat if there was a lid you could put over top of the whole thing so that the snack doesn't go stale but thats just a thought.  Really, these things are perfect for helping your child be independent and limited at the same time =)
+1	Love it! Great for kids!
+1	My mother-in-law bought these for my 14 month old, and I can't imagine not having them now. Our son snacks on cheerios, yogurt drops, goldfish, just whatever we have 2-3 times a day inbetween meals or on the go on a busy day. When he is being grumpy, this can be a great distraction until nap time actually rolls around, and we are having fun trying to teach him to say the word "snack" when he wants this. The soft plastic lid of this comes off, and is all completely top-rack dish washer safe. I say these aren't perfect because my son's favorite snack is cheerios, and honestly, my carpet looks like it rained cheerios every day, but that is just because of how my son holds the cup. He will hold it by the top with his thumb pressing down one of the soft flaps, and then waves the cup around flinging his snack everywhere. So like I said, these aren't perfect and completely spill proof to little messy eaters, but the independence this gives my son to snack when he wants to is just fabulous. I highly recommend these!
+1	These snack cups are AWESOME! I can put all sorts of small snack items (dried fruit, crackers, cookies, etc) in here, and my toddler can't get the lid off to make a mess. He can get his hand in all the way to the bottom to get the last few pieces (a problem I've had with other snack containers). Yes, if you have small crumbs and your child turns the cup upside down and shakes, you might have a little mess. However, it wasn't that big of a problem for me - just make sure you have fresh, whole pieces of your snack.
+1	I got these for my 3 year old and 14 month old daughters. I got them to replace my gerber ones that didn't keep anything in them if the child held them wrong. My kids can't get anything out by shaking these or holding them upside down. The only problem I had was my 14 month old sticks her hand in it and then tips it upside down, which keeps the top open and sometimes smaller stuff falls out. But all in all a very good product.
-1	Our toddler figured out how to pull the entire lid off by 16 months (we didn't introduce the cup until about 10 months, so we got less than 6 months of use out of it).  She pulls off the lid and pours the entire container of cheerios into her carseat.  Munchkin now sells a model with lock on lids.  Skip this model and go for the lock on lid one.  Your carseat will thank you.
+1	i like this because nothing falls out.but its kind of hard and the kid doesnt seem to like to put hands in as much as other brands.
+1	These are easy to use and fill. The opening is just the right size to keep the snack in and the handles are perfect for little hands. We use ours daily. My only complaint bought these is that they don't have air tight lids for traveling with snacks so the snacks don't go stale.  Other snack traps do feature a lid but these are by far the best at keeping the food in and the easiest for my son to use.
+1	we needed something for our son when we were on the go as he likes to hold his own snacks but also likes to throw them around. These are not perfect but you can't really expect them to be. They are easy to clean and hold a lot of snack options (crackers, cookies, fruit). We use these in the car, around the house, in the stroller etc. Very happy
+1	My son loves this cup, it's great for cereal, puffs, apple etc.The cup is good quality and top cover is hard to remove by kids.At the bottom of the snack catcher it says: this cup belongs to: and than there is place to put child's name with sharpie (good for daycare/multiple cups with other kids in use).After a while the top split parts are not 100% closed any more and little cheerios might "escape", but the cup is cheap and it can be replaced of this is a problem.
+1	These are thoughtfully designed. Our 14 month old uses them easily for snacking on cheerios. He loves to hold the container by its handles. Yes, sometimes he drops a few cheerios, but this still prevents a ton of mess. They are BPA free and seem very sturdy and safe. The munchkin packaging (not the shipping packaging, but the packaging on the actual snack catcher) was a pain.
+1	My son's aunt recommended these to us.  They're user-friendly and perfect for little toddler hands.  Although the cereal does fall out, there is a much smaller mess than there would be with a regular bowl.Sometimes a piece will get stuck in-between the flaps and if my son is shaking it (upside down usually), cereal will fly everywhere.  But that's to be expected.  Overall, it's a great invention.  The plastic lids are also super soft and flexible, being gentle on my son's soft hands.
+1	These are okay, good for the price. My toddler has figured out how to get the lids off though, so she still spills snacks all over the place. There's another snack catcher by munchkin that has a lockable lid. Get that one instead.
+1	Started using these for our kids 3 years ago, and still it's all we use. Our kids each started using them at around 10 months...  the tops they can't (or don't) pull off and they are easy to wash. Colors are great too!
-1	These are too hard for little ones to get hands in! The plastic is hard and not very flexible. My 16 month old could not get the snacks out to save his life. I tried it and I even found it difficult. Spend the extra money and get the munchie mug. It is the greatest thing since peanut butter!
+1	Let's face it, there's nothing that is going to be 100% toddler proof.  These are great but my twin toddlers quickly figured out how to remove the lids.  They come off pretty easily.  For the most part, though, they leave the lids on.  Occasionally, one of them shows me their &#34;bracelet&#34; which is one of the lids around their wrist...sometimes they reach in and pull their hand out with the lid.  But that could be something they do intentionally.  Any case, it would be a nice improvement if the lids locked on somehow, or even screwed on, so they were child-proof.  But for the price and for what it is, it works ok.
+1	These are a great product. My daughter has used them from about 10 months, but I would purchase them around 7 months -- think they would work well from that age. And well beyond. Great for the car or when you are at someone else's house and don't want to make a mess. Easy for her to use.
+1	When I first got this for my now 15 month old daughter she was 6-7 months old and just learning to eat cereal pieces, I thought this would be a great way to bring her snack on the go but at that age she was not able to figure out how to use it. She didn't know to push her hand thru the top to get the snack so I would remove the top and she would inevitably spill out all the cereal! Now that she knows how to use it's great, she can hold it in one hand and eat with the other, and when she throws it across the room it doesn't pop open or spill! The only other minor problem I have with it is that it does let crumbs spill out into my purse or diaper bag.  The other snack holder I would reccomend is the OXO tot, also easy to hold and use, snaps closed so no crumbs in my purse, but does pop open when thrown.
+1	My daughter is 9 months and this thing scares her. It's kind of cute. I know it will be a wonderful way to dispense snacks once she gets used to it. It is durable and washes easily.
+1	Our 18 month old has a small bowl of cheerios in the morning that he is allowed to eat in his reading chair.  Well, his new favorite game has been shaking the bowl and we end up with cheerios all of the floor.  These snack catchers are awesome.  He can still eat his cereal like a "big boy" and we don't have to deal with the "little boy" mess.  We do still end up with some cheerios on the floor, but that is mostly from him wanting to get as big of a handful as he can.I can't attest to how well these work in the car or "on the go" as we don't allow snacks in the car.
+1	I love these cups...At time it is not very easy to get the top on, but at the same time you know that your child will not be able to take it off and make a mess. Very durable, easy to clean, tops stay "close" for a long time and all -and-all I would recommend it.
+1	I bought these after reading the reviews.  They are MUCH better than the Gerber ones.  They dont "leak" out the goodies so easily or the crumbs.  Def a must have for little snackers
+1	I purchased 2 of these...one for my 3 yo and one for my 20 mo old.  They both love to have their own "bowl" of snacks but are always spilling.  These are WONDERFUL because they can carry the snacks around and I don't have to worry about them spilling.  Also great for eating out...keeps them happy and occupied while we eat dinner.  My 20 mo old figured it out in just minutes.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there was a storage lid you could put on either over or in place of the other lid...that way you could store the snacks in the cup (in your diaper bag or at home) w/o them getting stale.
+1	These are great for distraction-type snacks in our jogging stroller since it has no snack tray.  I worry that repeated removal of the lid will stretch it so the child will be able to remove it easily, so I don't take it off unless I have to - I just shove food in through the slits.  My only complaint is the lack of a lid so I can store in in my diaper bag already to go.  Not a huge deal though.  Very glad I bought these!  One of my girls hates to ride in a stroller (she likes to ride on my back) but sometimes she has to - this helps a lot.
+1	Great method for storing snacks on the go. While baby has the skills to push through the lid, she would rather i take it off. oh well!
+1	Snack Trap Cup are one of the best inventions ever, being the mother of a toddler I know. These may not be one of the cheapest snack trap cups, but they are one of the best.
-1	the qaulity sounds good but the cover is sillier then ever, its easy to remove and also hard to stick in hand,used it for a cup to drink
+1	These are great.  We have about 4 of them we fill with snacks.  They're great and our daughter (15 months now) has been using them since 9 months.  She figured out early on how to flip a piece of plastic and dump everything.  But, she learned that it's better keeping it in while walking with her hand stuck in there.  So, we love them.
+1	My one year old loves these!  We have been searching for a way for her to enjoy her snacks while on the move since she is now walking.  These hold in the snack even if she shakes them up and down! I do wish the colors were all the same price, instead of a cheaper price for various colors, so that way she could have a more girly cup, but its no biggie! I would definitely recommend this to all my mommy and daddy friends!
+1	Great for young babies/toddlers to eat their snacks without a big mess!  My twin boys don't like to sit still when they eat and with these I can let them roam around without me worrying about snack pieces spilling all over the house or where ever we happen to be!
-1	My eight month old son was able to figure out within a few minutes that he could hold these cups over his head and shake the cheerios right out of them.... cheerios went everywhere, all over his car seat, all over the store and when we got home (and my husband refilled his snack cup) all over my house.
-1	Only used them once or twice and now they sit in my cabinet... I have a 15 month old and I thought these would be cool to put his dry cereal and yogurt bites in. It didn't hold anything in when he tipped it upside down and shook it. We might try using these again in a few months when he's a little bit bigger, we'll see...
+1	what more can i say i like this idea. even my grandmother and aunt in laws are so amazed with these snack catcher. they said they haven't seen one before. this works great on the go, when we're in a hurry to leave i can just pour in snack and my son get occupied eating while traveling in the car. it prevents mess but not 100% unless you teach your toddler not to put their hand in the snack catcher and take the snack out. i told my son just get enough food you can put in your mouth at a time. then this snack catcher has served its purpose well. i'm happy with this purchase i have another baby and she's starting to learn to use this. glad there's two of them.
-1	I have a 1 year old and she makes a mess with these cups! She takes handfuls of whatever is in the cup, pulls it out and dumps it on the floor! No thanks!
+1	We received these a couple of days ago and they work GREAT!  My son can get his hand in and out, but my 75lb Golden Retriever can't get his mouth into it.  We had one of those gyro bowls which worked great, but our son would put it down and the dog would have a feast!HIGHLY recommend these to people with pets.
+1	I haven't seen anything better at helping contain cereal and other snacks.  When turning it upside-down and shaking, some of the cereal comes out, but not much.  It can also fall from a stroller, and keep most of the food safely inside, and clean.  The food also lasts longer in a Snack Catcher (fewer refills), since more food stays inside instead of getting thrown overboard.  Of course, a determined child can still throw all of the contents out and make a mess.  Overall, these work well and are the best option I've found.
+1	These are a great invention. It's easy for toddlers to get into them, but pretty difficult for food to get out. The colors are fun and pretty, and the handles on the sides make them easy for little hands to hold on. Great for foods like cheerios or even cut up veggies.
+1	These things are the greatest thing ever invented! They are a momma's best friend for a toddler. And my daughter loves them too...can't go wrong!
+1	While they are convenient and easy for my 11 month old to use, I find it annoying that they don't come with lids to keep snacks from going stale! They're an odd material that keeps dust and hair stuck to the inside with the snacks and that can be discouraging. Other than that, my son loves using them and they're safe in the dishwasher!
-1	My daughter is a strong 12-month old, but the flaps on snack catchers are so stiff that they trap her hand once she gets her fist inside. Now she resorts to trying to pick out cheerios from the container one at a time, however, each time she manages to get one out, 5-10 others pop out with it and fly everywhere, or she pushes 1-2 flaps in and tries to pour out the cheerios, and, of course, they fall out everywhere. It does a great job keeping the cheerios in as long as no one tries to get any out.
+1	I love these snack cups. My daughter as alway had problems eating, and her feeding therapist and GI doctor told me to buy these cups. I love them. They help slow the toddler that try to eat to fast down.
+1	I like to keep lots of these on hand.  Make sure you pick the colors you want if you are picky.
+1	I bought this set to split with another mother so we could give them a try. We love them!! These little snack cups are terribly convenient and I quite literally don't leave home without it. They're not 100% spill-proof of course, but they cut down on mess (and food maintenance) a great deal. Being able to hand my son his snack cup while I prepare a meal equals two satisfied parties. And have I mentioned errands and outings? Grocery shopping was made oodles easier after the snack cup.When your kid is peckish and you don't want to whip out a bib or otherwise be overly concerned with clean-up, the snack catcher is the way to go. (Yes, you will need to pick up a few errant crumbs or bits that have been shaken out, but the majority stays put.)Highly recommended product!
+1	This is loads of fun, handles on the side so small hands can hold, and then surprise the child can put their hand in the top, pull out their treat, eat, no spills, no mess,they can throw the cup on the floor and no spills.  We see many kiddo's at the zoo with these cups and just had to have one for our little girl.
+1	These are very handy snack holders.  Easy for tots to grab onto and hold.  I attach a handle to a "No Throw" strap for when she's in the stroller.I was disappointed that they don't all come with a stay fresh type of lid, so if you leave snacks in it for even a couple of hours, they do get stale very quickly.Today, I came up with a solution!  I noticed you can buy the lids to go over them to help keep the food fresh, OR...  *Drum roll please*  I happened to have an 8 oz. Daisy Sour Cream container lid lying around and VOILA - it fits perfectly snug over the rubbery top!  It's basically air tight!  I'm all about reusing/recycling so this was perfect!I'm so excited that I'll be able to fill up the snack cup, put the reused 8 oz. sour cream lid on it (on top of the rubbery part), and not worry that it will spill all over the diaper bag (it's not spill proof by any means!), and also that it should help to keep the snacks fresher!I was surprised at how flexible the rubbery top is - good because it won't hurt your baby's fingers, but bad because it doesn't rigidly stay in place (more spills).  My 20 month old daughter is getting really good about not pouring out all of her snacks, so these are getting more use now than they were a few months ago when purchased.Hold up fabulously in the dishwasher.I don't think I will buy any more of them, but I would recommend them for someone to try.**UPDATE**I have purchased another set of 2.  As my daughter gets older (27 months now), they are getting used a lot!  Before the snack catchers, I used to just let my daughter have a few pieces of snack in her lap (in the stroller).  I also occasionally let her eat snacks out of a ziploc bag, however, she will dump it out.  Going to go back to the snack catchers while shopping and see if she stops dumping snacks out.
-1	Somewhere I read that these toys are watertight, but it's not true. Condensation has developed inside both the mirror turtle and the rattle turtle in our set. In fact, the rattle doesn't make noise because the beads are stuck to the side. The entire set also tends to flip upside down when in the water. We still have these next to the tub, and they do provide a little visual interest from time to time, but I would not buy these again or recommend them unless the company makes some design changes. If you are unfortunate enough to have plunked down the money like I did, remember to store the spinning turtles upside down so that the water can drip out between uses. As for the other two, once the water gets in, you may never get it out (just hope your kid doesn't suck on them.....eeuuuuw!)
+1	We use these bath toys inside and outside of the bathtub :- ) they are very well done, good quality and grab your Childs attention of you are looking for this kind of activity in the bath tub. They also hold up pretty well. All and all, I would recommend this set.
-1	All children are different, and for me this was a complete waste of money.  My son didn't play with them when he was 1, and we brought them out later.  He still didn't.  Several times more...he's still completely disinterested.  I think it might be because he had soft squishy squirters first and these hard toys didn't interest him.  They also turn upside down all the time, which is annoying.You never know what your child will like!
-1	The womb noise is excellent and the lights are nice, but this thing is terribly built. The voice activation feature does NOT work. My son was screaming his head off and it didn't turn on at all. I also tested it myself at a few different volumes and tones and it has never turned on even once. It also only turns on about 60% of the time when I'm just trying to manually turn it on. At first I thought something was wrong with my batteries because the light would flicker a couple of times and then wouldn't turn on at all. I would return it if I had gotten it at a store, but don't feel like mailing it back in. I'd definitely NOT recommend this thing to anyone.
+1	SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but  when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib). By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds*  I WISH IT COULD BE  MORE  SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!
+1	I bought this because I already known the brand. But also I was curious about the &#34;Hot&#34; safety button, which is really helpful when having 2 kids. They understand if they can or not touch the window in order for them not to burn then selves.The price is quite right for a product like this!
-1	Short of duct tape and super glue, I tried everything to get these to stick to the windows and they will. not. stick. Complete waste of money and time. Not to mention dangerous should these hit a newborn in the face or head. Avoid this product at all cost.
+1	These worked perfectly in my son's car to block the sun from their new baby's face and is still being used because we got another grandbaby at the end of last year. Very easy to use and are effective.
+1	I purchased (2) sets of these and love them.  They are easy to install and easy to operate from the front or back seats.  The shades provide ample protection from sunlight to the grandchildren.
+1	I haven't had any issues with the suction cups staying stuck to the windows; but with that said, I did take a moist sponge to them before sticking them to the windows of my car and holding those suckers down for about 30 seconds. The issue I've had (which is so close to a non-issue it's not funny) is that the "hot" indicator stops being effective after a particularly hot day. It's been 40 degrees outside the past week and my "hot" indicators are still white. Also, do you really need a window shade to tell you that the car is warm inside?Other than the ridiculous "white hot" indicators I like these shades; they've been the most durable I've used yet over the past 2 years.
-1	I'm going to start by saying right now - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I applied these according to its directions exactly, taking good care to secure the suction cups tightly, while I was cleaning my car.I then went inside. I came outside five minutes later and both had fallen, each time I tried to re-attach them, they fell right after I attached them. I then decided to roll them back up and take them down, but realized that the casing that holds the shade actually cracked by falling on a cushioned seat repeatedly.In addition, I attached them in mild 50 degree weather and the heat sensor said it was 'HOT', much too &#34;hot&#34; to touch!These are the most faulty piece of crap products I've ever purchased! The heat sensor is a sham in EVERY Munchkin product I have purchase, the suction cups are extremely faulty, and the shades never roll back up!Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
-1	I guess I am never going to find a sun shade that actually sticks to my windows.  Even with cleaning them often using alcohol, as the manual suggests, they fall off every single day.  How frustrating!  Might as well save myself the frustration and get my windows tinted!
-1	I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick. Also they don't really block the sun either, I don't think any product like these would. I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face.
+1	such a space saver for the cabinet and everything is so much easier to reach now  this is my 2nd organizer
+1	I keep all my baby girl's food on this, and it takes up half the space it used to take. Now I can stay organized!
+1	This item is so helpful.  It keeps all my baby food jars nice and organized.  So much easier to find the exact food I am looking for.  My pantry was a mess before I got this.It was a little tricky at first to put it together (the instructions don't specify that you should twist the shelves to lock into place).  But once I figured it out, it works fine.This item works for jars only, by the way.  If you buy the Gerber baby food that comes in plastic tubs, it won't work on this organizer.  I mostly buy Earth's Best baby food and it fits perfectly.  In fact, in the photo on the box it came in, that is exactly what they show it being used with.
-1	If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan, which I thought it would, it would have  a much better rating.  But turning this thing doesn't really work.  Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet.
+1	Holds all of his baby food jars..EARTH'S BEST ORGANICS HAVE BPA..Just something I recently discovered.This thing is awesome, holds all of his foods and it looks really cute.I keep it fully stocked, and it holds all of his munchkin spoons on the top.One negative star because if you turn it the wrong way by the shelf it falls down.. LOL.That could be a messy expensive mistake so I'm really careful with it.Enjoy yours, you'll love it too!!! &lt;3
+1	This is a fantastic space saving product. I love that you can adjust the shelves to accommodate different height jars and I love that you can tuck it in the cabinet and have all your baby food organized and ready to pluck off the shelf! The only thing potential purchasers should know is that it does not rotate, despite the fact that it is circular. I highly recommend!!
+1	I purchased this for my son who isn't born yet but 2 of my friends with 8-10 month olds told me I had to have one. This may not be that practical for me since I plan on making home made baby food but my friends love this thing.
+1	I found this product cheaper at Walmart.  The only difference is the middle portion is white.  I like that I'm able to turn the shelves to view the baby food.  I don't like it doesn't allow you to turn each shelf individually.  I also wish it would hold more than 24 jars of food.  But for less than $9.00, it's a great deal so I recommend it.
+1	This worked perfect for my 6 month old grandson.  It has saved me from leaning over the tub and a lot of back ache.  Perfect to put in the kitchen sink.
+1	It's a great product cuz it lasts a long time.  I used this in the kitchen sink when my baby was a newborn and then we put it in the bathtub when he got older.  I also really like the slots for the shampoo, etc... It's big enough that my son could probably fit in it until he's ready for showers.  And of course it's cheap.A couple of minor issues:I washed the hammock with the laundry and it shrank, so I guess I'll have to find another one for the next baby.I wish this tub would fold, compact items are just so much better.I wish I could hang it up or something to  get it out of the way-it just sits in our bathtub and is in the way when the adults go in to shower.
+1	This was an excellent infant tub. I was so worried at first to wash my baby perfectly and this tub allowed me to do so, while allowing comfort to my baby. We used this tub for quite a while, until she was ready to transition to a full grown-up tub.
+1	We really love this tub. We opted to get the one without the hammock and we have not needed it. When bathing our newborn, I just had to keep one hand on his head to keep him from leaning too far onto one side. Now, at 4 months old, he's almost ready to use the sitting up side of the tub. The tub is large and comfortable and the compartment on the side is great for holding the washcloth. I do wish they made a version that folds up for easier storage, but a friend of mine owns one that folds up and it leaks all over the place.
+1	This tub is awesome. We bathed my daughter with the infant mesh part since two days old. It's light, easy to clean, and works perfect. Even when you take the mesh out and use the tub there are the two sides (one tilted back and one sitting) which grows with your baby. We also loved the heat indicator, we never worried about bathing our little girl. The one negative we found was that at about 6 months our daughter outgrew it, wish I would have lasted longer!
-1	We got this and used it on our daughter from when she was a newborn. We only bathed her a couple of times a week for the first 2 months, then every other day until she was 6 months old, and now 5 times per week. However, the plug kept shedding rubber - pieces were coming off - almost every time I used it. It is now held together by a thin sliver of rubber, and removing it is a gentle wiggling process and pushing it out from the bottom. She's just 10 months old.The setup is sort of awkward. The sling was the worst. If I had to go back to newborn, I'd never fill the tub with water, but use the sling just for sponging and rinsing with an external stash of water. For the rest, until she was heavier than 15 pounds and able to sit on her own, she kept stretching out and floating upward (and this is having her head on the toddler/child side, which props them straight up). There is a knob there that is supposed to catch their butts, but if the baby is too light I guess it doesn't work. I had to fashion a sort of belt to hold her in until she got big enough. Now that she is big enough, she can wiggle around and splash and have fun.I'm not entirely sure what the reservoir behind her head is for. I stash the soap bottles and stuff there, but it often fills with dirty/soapy bathwater water. I'm not sure if it's there for water or what. Actually, there are a lot of such places that hold water. There are grooves in the side that aren't useful but are an artifact of the molding process. They are annoying to clean and are the first to feel gooky, so I guess they let me know when it's time to scrub out the tub with bleach.This tub is for children, but there is a big warning that it contains small parts and isn't suitable for children below 3 years. So what gives?Anyway, it holds water. Or it will until the plug is done breaking.
+1	This tub works very well for us.  The sling was great when he was a newborn, but he likes baths much better now being in the water.  I like that the cushion is on the tub, he fits well on the seat, and I like the extra little tub for water.  When the rest gets all soapy, I can use it for fresh water.
+1	We just got received this tub for our 2 month old son.  His old tub was a foldable version by the same company, and he had already outgrown it and his feet were getting stuck.  This one solved the problem, and for the first time he really enjoyed his bath!  He has room to kick and play here, and I had a ball bathing him and watching him smiling and having fun.  So glad I bought this!
+1	We've loved this little tub!  We used the sling insert for the first few weeks, then moved our new baby girl to the infant side.  The non-slip coating on the infant ramp and "bump" in the bottom of the tub kept her safely upright while I washed her.  She quickly discovered how much fun a bath can be!  When she was able to sit up on her own, we moved her to the "toddler" side of the tub so she could sit upright.  Baths became even more fun (and the kitchen even more wet!).  I've recently retired this tub and moved our now 1 year old to the big bath tub and I must say I miss how much easier it was to bathe her in this tub.
+1	We got this tub as a hand me down when our baby was born, but due to all the craziness that goes along with having a newborn and all the hand me downs that we received and had to sift through, we didn't start using this tub until after baby was a month old.  So we never used the hammock/sling that came with it.What I love about the tub is that it fits perfectly in our kitchen sink which is the perfect height for washing baby standing up.  I've always seen others wash their babies in a tub on the floor or in the bathtub.  I've tried that, and bending over or even sitting on a little stool to do so was cumbersome and not very comfortable at all.  So far so good. I don't really have any complaints about the tub. We'll see how it goes as baby grows.  We're still using the reclining infant side for our 3 month old.
+1	I received this tub as a baby shower gift when I was pregnant with my son.  My husband and I were so excited to finally use it when our baby's cord stump fell off.  We didn't use the hammock part, we just put him in the infant seat in the tub so he would be warmer.  He loves the bath and I feel secure using it.  He fits in it perfectly and I don't worry about him slipping around in it.  The tub has little places to put your soap and wash clothes.  It also has a little plug on the side to drain the tub, although, honestly, I just flip the thing over and dump it out in the bathtub.  We set it in our master bathroom bathtub and I sit in the empty space left over. I don't worry about splashes or filling it. I highly recommend this tub to all new moms.
+1	I really can't rate this item, per se, because my grandson hasn't arrived yet.  But, from the looks of the product now that it has arrived, I think it will be great!  I researched a lot of baby tubs prior to picking this one...I think it will be perfect for 'Gabby's' house visits.
-1	I thought this was a model that I had purchased many years ago fro my last child, and it turns out to have changed. It is awkward to place in the kitchen sink, and is odd to place the baby in. My daughter is still quite small, so it may get better the larger she becomes, however, in comparison to other tubs that I have owned, this is by far the worst.
+1	I haven't used other tubs to compare this one to, but it met our needs just fine.  We used the sling when he was a newborn, and now my 12-month old is still using the bath on the toddler side.  He slides around too much in the regular tub, and this keeps him more under control, and it uses much less water than filling up the whole tub.The temperature gauge has to get pretty darn hot to start changing color, so I don't use it.  I never use it outside of the sink or tub, so I'm not sure how the leaking is.No mildew problems so far, and I just drain it and air-dry it after each use.
+1	I think it is a good bath tub for this price.It looks nice and  for different ages but I find it hard to wash my newborn s back because you can not turn him around when he is in the net/sling.So I need to wash his back first and then put him in tub,a little inconvenient.Overall I like the product.
+1	I would recommend these for even adults! They are easy to apply and work well. My only issue is I wish there were more of the sticky tape.
-1	I do not like this product.  I had similar product by a different manufacture and was running out so I bought this.  Bad bad bad.  First, it's so hard to remove the plastic that is attached to adhesive, second, it won't stick to toilet seat( because adhesive is not good and because adhesive part comes off when removing the plastic).  And because of the lack of and the poor quality of the adhesive, This toiler seat does no good because it just falls into the toilet before you even use it.  Because you can't flush it down the toilet, you would have to pick up the seat that has fallen into the toilet BEFORE it's even used, so not only it works but also you would be picking this up from the toilet bowl.  No use.  I do not recommend this product.  I would give zero star if I could.
+1	I ordered these for my potty training daughter. I am disgusted by the thought of public pottys and my daughter has to hold on to the seat to balance. Lining it with toilet paper just doesnt work for the little ones. I bought these actually thinking they overlapped the seat and hung down a little. They ONLY cover the actual seat top. They fit toilets great and stay in place with the little stickers. I carry them with me everywhere. They actually helped too with her public potty anxiety...I could bribe her with using her "elmo potty seat". She was terrified of the the auto flushers, because they kept flushing with her on it. If you dont already know this...cover the sensor with some TP before use and then it wont flush with your kid on it! :)
+1	It's a life saver for public washrooms that aren't smart enough to have seat covers available.  It's thicker and more comfortable that the flimsy ones anyway.  Sesame Street design made it an immediate hit with our daughter who got a little freaked out by our earlier attempts at lining seats with toilet paper.  Definitely worth having on hand.
+1	Even though my preschooler is 4 years old, I still use this when we go out to public restrooms.  This way, I don't have to freak out about him touching every where.
+1	Was going to NYC for a weekend, with two kids and really needed a bunch of toilet toppers for the less than pristine toilets of the city.  These did the job, at at a fairly reasonable price.  They have enough cover, and are waterproof which is a must.
+1	So far, these are the only training pants that I have tried that have worked for me to last through an accident and not leak all over the place.  For the reusable potty training pants out there, these are absorbant enough so it doesn't leak through, soft on the outside so it doesn't resemble a plastic bag on his bum, and allows for him to feel the wetness to realize that he's had an accident.
+1	I have been using these with my 2-year old as he starts to get used to the idea of potty-training.  They are super soft and comfy and he LOVES to put them on.  They really feel like underwear, but do a great job at containing minor pee incidents.
+1	Firstly,I have to admit that I bought these to use &#34;for the wrong reason&#34; meaning not as intended to be used. My son is day trained and we are moving on to night. I wanted something to contain as much of the accident as possible but still let him feel wetness. These work perfectly. They wouldn't hold a big giant pee accident, but I wouldn't expect them to. They wash and dry well and are comfy and not too bulky.
-1	Imse Vimse skimps on quality and has issues with training pants:*  Too thick for hot weather (don't need exterior cotton, or use thinner exterior cotton)*  Cheap, thin elastic is knotted/tied up along leg openings, so you feel a knot and pinching of thin, rubber band-like elastic (Imse should use comfortable sheer but wide spandex elastic instead of these rubber bands)*  Waist is too tight to easily pull down (even for my skinny toddler; so I removed elastic along the front of the waist)*  Waist is too high*  Rear needs to be wider (even for skinny toddlers)*  Shrinks in the wash, so I would order one size up
+1	These work great but they are a little costly for underwear.  They catch the pee and I like that the patterns can be used for boys or girls.
+1	As soon as we started using the Imse Vimse training pants, we loved them. They are such high quality for the money. The cotton is really thick and comfortable, it's organic and the prints are so cute. Plus, they hold up REALLY well even with lots of laundering. I know I'll be able to use these with younger siblings. They are perfect for day training and at night we pair them with a Bummis Whisper Pant or fleece pull up. When our son is night trained, we'll eliminate the covers all together. Even though are really thick and absorbent, the Imse Vimse pants look and feel kind of like "big kid" underwear.
+1	These are awesome training pants! They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I've found. They look like real underwear. Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents. They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training.
+1	These are great and every single time we have used these we haven't had anything leak outside of the underwear. I bought two & Im very satisfied with them
+1	These are wonderful. Please wash a few times before wear to increase the absorption of the organic cotton. These pants, as well as the velour version, are much thicker than most and hold more pee. The brilliant part though is they-feel-pee and your-sofa-isn't ruined because there is a PUL liner hidden. This is the same thing that the baby's cloth diapers use and the reason they are more expensive than others. If you are at the late stage of training and just want a little extra coverage, buy something cheaper. These protect your house without another bulky cover. They also contain poop really really well. Even uper big accidents--never a leak once.Some people expect training pants to contain as much pee as a diaper or a toxic/potting training delaying/expensive disposable pull up. Um, no, and you shouldn't expect them to. A few accidents and the occasional pair of pants that need a change are fine and just part of the process.
+1	It works, it survives one accident if it's not &#34;big&#34; one. It's cute and my daughter does not mind wearing it because it has cute prints and it does not have diaper feel to it.
+1	This is a really great kit full of all the 1st aid things you need.  I especially love the tweezers and ice pack because with little ones, those are things you need as much as bandages and ointment.  I also love that it comes in a really cute case and has stickers inside.  It helps with frightened little ones to have a fun bag, fun bandaids and stickers.  and for the price, it is really a great kit to have on hand.  I'm a nanny, so I got this to keep in my car for when we go on outings.
-1	I was aware before purchasing what items the medibag contained (it says in the product description), so I was not disappointed in that aspect; I purchased it mainly for the case anyway. Yes the case is cute and practical and can fit quite a few first aid items in it. But you would think being made out of a hard plastic that it would last a good while; that wasn't the case with the one I received. Not even a month after purchase one of the sides has already broken off and the other is coming loose. I still use it, I just can't carry it by the handles any more. I don't regret the purchase because the contents have been useful and the case is still good for storing and keeping things organized but it probably wasn't worth the $13. I wouldn't purchase again.
+1	Good for infant below 9 months old. Sweat banana favour and my son loves it. It's so sweet to watch him smile when he taste the toothpaste.I supposed the toothpaste is safe for consumption.For toddler, you may like to try thishttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3MGU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0009F3MGU&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20
+1	my 5 mth old loves the taste of this as well as the feel of the bristles. makes gum brushing easy. :)
+1	I used the little gum cleanser once, never again!  My baby clamped down on my finger excitedly  and it was very painful.  So I just squeeze a little dab of the toothpaste on a banana training toothbrush and use that.  My son loves it!  I brush his three teeth and his gums first, then I let him take over.  He enjoys rolling the toothbrush around in his mouth and chomping on the bristles.  This has become part of his bedtime routine, and he actually enjoys the whole process now.
+1	My daughter is 7 months old now and she gets so excited seeing me pull out the finger brush. She LOVES to chew on it more then any other teether we own. She likes the flavor of the tooth paste a lot. I actually have to stop and take my finger away or she would never let me go! It sticks really well to my finger, I'm never worried that it will come off in her mouth, I have to literally peel it off my finger. I just rinse it under the tap and it stays clean. I've put it in the dishwasher before and it came out fine. I think it's a great introduction to brushing and hopefully she will like our upgrade to the banana brush next!
+1	My 1-yr old finally has 2 teeth so I wanted to get in the habit of brushing every night. This cleaner had great reviews so i purchased it. My child LOVES the taste and is always pointing for me to put more of this on her toothbrush.
-1	My son has a severe dairy allergy and there is dairy in this toothpaste! Even if your child doesn't have a dairy allergy children should not have cows milk until they are a year old.
+1	I like this product but be careful to use after three months and please be careful with the thimble like application it can potentionally be a choking hazard
+1	This is a must! I love that it has ZERO FLOURIDE! and the little blue finger brush is super handy :)
+1	I liked the fact that this toothpaste had xylitol (sp?) in it for tooth protection.  The finger brush works great until they get sharp little teeth. I've switched to a regular baby toothbrush because she started chomping down on my finger around 10.5 months (babies can bite hard!), but the finger brush is a nice wy to start.  She always enjoys brushing her teeth and I like knowing that it's safe for her to swallow.
+1	My 3mo old loves the toothbrush!  I also got him the banana toothbrush, but he likes this one better because Mommy does the work!  I make him hold his banana toothbrush himself. I like that he gets practice with his banana toothbrush, but I get it done with this one!He seems to like the taste of the toothpaste.  I think it smells good, but am afraid to try it.  The finger brush makes it real easy to  clean his whole mouth.If there was an improvement to make, I would say that a case for finger brush would be great.  I use a ziploc bag and throw it away, but a sanitary case would be awesome.
+1	our daughter is 9 months old and loves the flavor of this and loves to have her teeth and gums brushed. we always brush during bathtime and i swear she would let us brush for an hour while she chews on it at the same time. start the brushing early and it becomes a habit that they look forward to
+1	I have been using this for many months now and my 17 month old daughter still loves it.  We use a regular toothbrush for in the morning and then we use this finger one when its bath time.  She has always enjoyed brushing her teeth with the finger cleaner.  I think it feels really good on her gums and it gets her teeth clean too.  The toothpaste seems to taste good because she always looks forward to using it.  It has a really nice smell.  It is very convenient for bath time and I would recommend it to others.
+1	For one year to start a good dental hygiene, he loves having his gum massaged, it also gives a refreshing taste.
+1	My LO cut her first tooth at 4 months.  We didn't use the toothpaste at first since she had not had any food yet (not by any doctor's decree, just being cautious).  We just wet the finger brush and wiped all her gums and tooth.  Then she got the second tooth and started some food around 5 months.  The toothpaste (I tried it) is pleasant and is sweet, but nothing too crazy.  We brush her teeth morning and night and it has held up very well (she is 7 months now).  The finger brush allows you to get all those gums and around the teeth pretty well.  We own a baby tooth brush too, but right now, I prefer this-- especially at night when I am in the dark since it is easier to manipulate.
+1	I love nuk products and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby's skin soft after bath time!
+1	My little man has just gotten his first teeth, so of course we needed a baby tooth brush!  This item is awesome.
+1	My daughter is getting her first teeth, and this toothbrush/cleanser set makes brushing them something she looks forward to.  She clearly likes the taste of the cleanser and the texture of the brush (attached to my finger). . . when I bring them in view, she smiles and opens wide, ready to chew her teeth clean.  My finger survives just fine, too, as the brush is made from thick enough material.
+1	First of all, when I read the ingredients on the package I went "yuck". But the more I looked at them, I realized that it wasn't actually bad at all - it was actually excellent! The main tooth decay ingredient is Xylitol. Check out the wiki page on this to get a better feel for how good this sugar alcohol is. It has all kinds of studies indicating that it can help tooth decay significantly and has no known toxicity issues. The sugar alcohol is derived from trees and seems very safe.This is important. My kids are not old enough to realize that they can't swallow the toothpaste and I still need to keep their teeth clean ...As a side note, they use Xylitol in chewing gum. In fact it is in many of the more expensive chewing gum brands that promote healthy teeth.This is the only beginner toothpaste we use in our house. Check out the wiki page on Xylitol  and I can say pretty confidently that you will use this as your only toothpaste with kids that may swallow their toothpaste.Other than the Xylitol, the rest of the ingredients are pretty innocuous and are claimed to be all natural. So there you are.Thanks!!
+1	I think the toothpaste tastes a little funny but daughter really likes it.  She does not want anything to do with the finger toothbrush though, and we use either the baby banana toothbrush or the baby buddy first toothbrush.  Given that you use so little toothpaste, this little tube lasted us for several months.
+1	Highly recommend this.FANTASTIC BABY BRUSHThis is an excellent baby brush - we bought this for the brush alone - toothpaste will be a nice extra when we start using it (just water and the brush with an infant for now - and baby loves it).  He actually smiles and opens wide.  This is contrast to using a wet cloth to wipe his gums and teeth which made him cry.  It must feel like a baby gum massage or something.The brush is like a large, soft thimble with a mini brush (very soft) on the finger pad.  You put it over your index finger and rub it on baby's teeth and gums.  From what we read (including from the American Dental Association), you should start some kind of brushing this as soon as baby starts teething, but toothpaste seems optional for infants.TOOTHPASTEWe're not using the toothpaste yet, so I hesitate to comment on it - other that you can see from most of the other reviews that the toothpaste is a big winner too.
+1	I started using this about a week ago with my 5 1/2 month old son. He has 3 teeth and is working on the 4th! I was worried about using the brush with his gums being so sensitive with the new tooth breaking through but he LOVES it! The "bristles" are much softer than they appear in the picture. I use just a tiny bit of the paste and start massaging his teeth and gums. He likes to hold my finger and "do it himself" too. Now when he sees me get out the finger brush he gets excited! Hopefully we are setting good hygeine habits for the future!The only downside I have is that the finger brush is a little big for me which is weird because I have rather large fingers for a female. I just make sure to hold onto it with my thumb so it doesn't come off in baby's mouth. It's not enough of a problem for me to reduce my rating though.Happy brushing!
+1	My kid hates brushing his teeth but at least this product has a good taste to it that helped the whole nightly process go smoother.
+1	I used this product with my first baby and plan to use again with baby #2. My son loved the flavor, and the cleaning brush is gentle, but introduces the sensation of brushing. Sometimes I would use the brush to massage his gums when they were teething. Also, the brush and the cleaner last for a long time, so it's worth the price.Keep away from dogs though... we lost quite a few to our lab who thinks this is a tasty chew toy.PROS:Convenient useEasy to cleanPortableSturdy constructionCONS:Dogs love them
+1	Getting babies teeth brushed as soon as they start to have teeth is very important. In order for them to brush their teeth regularly, one should start a routine at early stages of their life. This gum cleanser is doing a good job, and it's pretty easy to use. If you make this as a game with the baby, s/he won't refuse it as well. After the use his/her mouth smells great.
+1	Teeth cleaning gel is great but the rubbery finger toothbrush is not great for the finger in it when the infant bites down. It's soft for their gums but I found that for my children I needed to use a soft bristle toothbrush to avoid getting my cover bit through the rubber fiver tooth brush.
+1	We heard that it wasn't really critical to brush our son's gums when he was just getting his first teeth, but we also read that the big reason to brush is so that it becomes a habit that your child will be used to as part of his/her bedtime routine. Our son didn't mind this little rubber brush at all, and seemed to enjoy having his teeth brush. When we switched to a &#34;real&#34; (kids) toothbrush we got from his dentist at 14 months it was an incredibly easy transition. We haven't had to use the gum cleanser yet, but I'm sure it will also be great, as I've heard great things about Xylitol.
+1	The best travel solution if you don't want to bring a whole bunch of little baby brushes. My son loved it! The only trouble we had was that he'd occasionally bite my finger but that has nothing to do with the product ;)
+1	My son is 10-months old, and we've been using this product even before he had teeth starting at 4 months.  We used it to clean his gums and rub the milk residue off it.  Works great, and he actually loves chewing on it!  I still don't understand how the tooth paste is flavored and good for you, but it does what it claims though.  I plan to purchase this product all the way up until he has a full set of teeth, before converting to a real toothbrush.  I only wished that it came with 2 of the gum cleansers, instead of only 1.
+1	good product
+1	My daughter used to refuse the bottle, even with my breastmilk in it. My mother, who has been working in a nursery for 30 years, suggested the problem could be the material the nipple was made of and the slow flow. These nipples work with Medela bottles once screwed and they flow nicely for my 4-month-old daughter. She now takes the bottle when I am not around!
-1	I did not receive the item pictured or described.  I did receive gerber latex nipples that were 4m+ flow, but not the thick latex with the bottom venting and the 3 holes.  That said, the item I did receive is still a nice nipple, just not what I wanted or that work for my baby.  The ones I received were thinner latex, like the Enfamil disposables, with a side vent much like that found on nuke nipples.
+1	This is the first time we bought latex nipples, so maybe they are all a little noisier than the silicone ones.  But those ones leaked horribly for us, and these don't have that problem.
+1	I have tried to get my breastfed boy to take a bottle for quite a long time. After several attempts with other nipples, such as tommee tippee, and nuk, I have found this is the only one he will actually take! Such a relief! He takes it without any issues or spitting it out (which he did with every other nipple). And he still breastfeeds just fine and takes the bottle when I need him to! Best of both worlds!
-1	First tip don't wait 6 weeks to give you baby a bottle!!!  I did and now I am paying the price of her being 4 months and still won't take a bottle unless so very hungry (aka daycare) but she is adapting the wrong way and holding out all day (daycare) and waking up all night to eat.  When I was on leave she ate all day and slept for 8-10 hours at night.  I am lucky to now get a 4 hour stretch of sleep...Anyway...these nipples were too small for my breastfeed baby.  Plus the latex nipple smelled like latex even after boiling.  I'm pretty sure that's not something a baby would like to smell while eating.  I don't know if you could taste the rubbery taste, but either way she didn't like these and I bought 8, yes 8!!! different brands, the gerber, nuk, medela, mimijumi, Lansinoh mOmma, 1st years breastflow, advent, and tommee.  Tommee was the winner, she still doesn't like it, but it is the one that doesn't make her cry at the sight of it and she will &#34;play&#34; with it and drink something.  It isn't any of these brands fault, its mine for listening to the lactation consultant.  She is my 2nd baby, my first we introduced a bottle 2nd day of life and she never had nipple confusion and I nursed for for 14 months!Good luck!
+1	I received these bottles as a gift and decided to give them a try after trying out so many bottles (expensive to cheap) with disappointment. The nipple flow on these bottles are perfect (not too fast or slow), it doesn&#8217;t leak at all, cleans easily, and lightweight. For the price, it's def worth it!
+1	I tried virtually all of the non-spill sippy cups out there, from cheap to expensive. I ended up buying about 10 more of these (and the bigger ones), and tossing the rest, because:They don't spill. Even when my toddler bangs them on his tray table/shakes them upside down, they generally do not let out the liquid (the ones with softer spouts, that are more like bottles, would spill all over if banged/pushed on).They are easy(er) to clean. I still have to take out the valve from the lid, but it's only one plastic piece, not many.The lids and valves for the 2 sizes are interchangeable, so I don't have to keep track of anything.My son can hold them no problem.I like the bright colors. My son likes to pick which one he wants.My only slight suggestions:Make the measurement (oz) label a bit easier to read.
+1	These are sturdy sippy cups, but with the way they are designed, it's impossible for my toddlers to get the last bit of milk out.
+1	Finally switched my 14-month-old to these (after using the NUK silicone spouts with regular bottles to ease transition) and I LOVE them! Did a lot of research on which sippy cups to get and these do not disappoint. I can throw one in my purse without worrying--NO LEAKS! It does take some determination for my kid to get the liquid out, but she eventually figured it out and now has no trouble. Same goes for grasping. Just took a day or two. Did I mention no leaks?? Highly recommended!!
+1	Gerber Fun Grips are my favorite, they are easy to clean and they really are spill proof.  I use this size for water and juice and the bigger ones for milk.
+1	We were trying to transition our daughter to sippy cups and we were having some difficulty.  We were able to get her to start using the soft spout cups for water, but milk she would still only take from a bottle.  Maybe it was just time, or maybe there was something to these cups, but now she drinks milk solely out of these.Pros:- They are a nice size for little hands to manage.  Now at 16 months she is able to use the largerGerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Varyones as well, but when we first started transitioning, the bigger ones were too awkward for her to maneuver.- It's nice that the lids and valves are all interchangeable between the 7 and 10 ounce models. Organization has not been our strong suit since the baby came, so it's nice not to have to worry about finding the "right one."- Everything cleans easy in the dishwasher, we just place the valves in thisMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Varyand have had no problems.- They have lived up to their spill proof name, as well as proven rather sturdy.  My daughter still likes to toss these to the floor, though with less regularity at least.  Despite all the impact to the hardwood floors, they have held up to the abuse and continue to not leak or spill.- The cups have little ounce markers on the side so you know how much liquid you put in the cup and/or was consumed.We liked these so much, we bought two more sets of them.
+1	I love these cups!  The size is great (slightly smaller than the normal sippy cups) - the size is especially nice for taking on a trip or just throwing in the diaper bag so water is available.  Plus, they do not leak, which is a must for us!  We definitely like them.
+1	I dont think any sippy cups is 100% leak proof, but this comes close. A few drops leak out every now and then, but these are great quality and my son loves them.
+1	My daughter loves to do everything she can to make her sippy cups leak and make a huge mess.  After I opened these to test them out, the first thing she did was turn it over and start shaking it....and NO LEAKS.  Hallelujah!
+1	These truly are leak-proof cups, and are a great supplement to our current larger Gerber Graduate cups.  I like that they have a more narrow base and easily fit into cup holders, unlike their larger counterparts.  Great sippy cups, and a favorite in this family!
+1	Great cups. The only ones I've found that truly don't leak. Easy to clean and assemble.
+1	These cups are much bigger than they look - we can put an entire 8.25 oz Enfagrow drink in here.  Also, since the base is smaller, it fits in all traditional cup holders.  I buy only Gerber Graduates/NUK for Gerber Grads cups now since all the lids and parts are interchangeable.  That really comes in handy!  We've never had a leak issue as long as you place the white guard in securely enough.  Sometimes my daughter bangs them hard enough to knock it out, but that's an easy fix.
+1	This cup hasn't spilled on us, is easy to clean, is easy for my 17-month-old to grip, and fits easily in cup holders.  Would certainly buy again.
-1	I dont really like this item because of the stopper inside. The piece that's supposed to allow liquid through when your child sucks on the cup is too firm and my 1 year old cannot get anything to come out. Sure its spill proof..... because you can't even suck the liquid out of this cup. Never fear.... your never gonna spill any liquid with this cup, cause you can't get it out!!!!
+1	I, and my daughter of course, love these cups. They were smaller than i thought (6 oz) but they are great for juice at snack time ect... My daughter is just transitioning from bottles to cups and these work great.
+1	I love these cups. I take out the valve so the water flows freely. It's one of the only cups my daughter will use. Great size (not to big or small) and they hold up well over time.
+1	Best sippy cups.  We have tried countless others and all others leak.  These dont leak and are super durable.  Our daughter loves to throw these around and they still look like they are brand new after 6 months
+1	I was concerned about my daughter fighting me to brush her teeth but after using this a few times, she really loves brushing her teeth. It helps her feel better when she's teething and is great to train with because she's still too little for an actual toothbrush.
+1	Our 9 month old has been known to throw a tantrum or two.  Changing, feeding, bathing, all can become a battle of wills and a test of our patience.  All that said...  she has never given us even an ounce of hassle about brushing her teeth.  When she sees either my wife or I coming with the little finger tip brush, she opens right up and let's us brush her teeth...  all two of them.  While she does bite down, she hasn't bitten down with the force of the other reviewer's kid, and for that I guess I'm grateful.  Anyway, the toothpaste is apparently great tasting and my only advice is to remember to replace the finger tip brush the same as you would any toothbrush.  It wears just the same, and in fact, ours wore down before we finished the toothpaste that it came with.If you are need for a product to clean your baby's teeth/gum, I recommend this one.
-1	This is a great toothpaste-- my 9-month-old loves it and she enjoys having her teeth brushed so much that she cries when I take the brush out of her mouth.  The thing I hate about the fingertip brush is that my daughter (proud owner of 8 sharp teeth) likes to BITE down on my poor index finger inside the silicone sleeve.  No matter how often I tell her "no", it is hard for her to get the concept that when I put something in her mouth, she is not to chomp down on it with all her might. To remedy this, I try holding just the tip of the finger sleeve and gently let her chew away on it, but that poses a very dangerous hazard as she could potentially swallow it if I don't hold onto it with a very firm grip-- which is difficult to do with a wet, slippery piece of silicone.  Plus, she has now bitten off a couple of the silicone bristles and they are no where to be seen.  So, overall I understand the concept of this toothbrush and it may be great for younger babies, perhaps with no teeth.  But I'm definitely looking for something in between this and a regular hard-bristled toddler toothbrush.  Keeping the toothpaste though, like I said, it's a great toothpaste.
+1	Installation for this product was really quite easy.  When I first opened the package, I was a little weary of all the parts, but it turns out there are really two categories of "extra" parts: spacers (for the thickness of the bowl) and two other pieces (one for a taller rim, one for a shorter rim).  It actually only took me about 30 seconds to install tightly so there isn't much play.I will probably order another one for another install.
+1	Wish it had directions for adults though like up arrows.  Countless guests I have to explain it to, so I just now leave off when I have guests over.  Other than that it is super nice.
+1	This took seconds to install and was working great from the beginning.  I put it at about 7 o'clock.  I am not sure why this has so many negative reviews, our little girl bangs the lid up and down a quarter inch testing it every day and it has held up well so far.
+1	Boy do I love this product!  Easy to get on and super easy to open and shut.  Hard for guests- we have already had 2 ripped off the toilet and broken by guests too shy to ask how to open the toilet.  Our newest one has instructions written on it (by me) and the plastic piece on the lid has plenty of room to write these!
+1	After multiple iPhone dunks in various toilets around our house, as well as cloggings from who knows what (I REALLY don't want to know what was flushed) it was time to go hard core.As always, I read reviews for as many different products as I could find that do the same thing, and settled on buying three of these.The only criticism I saw was addressed by some smart user's suggestion to add some tacky material to the lip of the toilet bowl (like the stuff you line drawers with) if your lock slips (and only one of mine did, due to toilet design).Easily and quickly installed all three locks and waited for the gremlin to appear to see how he would react (and more importantly, if he could open or break it).  As I sat watching from behind the door, I heard the pitter patter of tiny, cloved feet approach the toilet...him thinking no one was around to see his evil dunking deeds.But lo...as the miniature, but amazingly dextrous hands went to open the toilet seat per usual...something held!  It worked! IT WORKED! GLORY DAY IT HELD!  I observed from the shadows as the expression on the would-be evil doer's face went from devilish grin to complete shock and surprise at this new and unfortunate (for him) development.  He fiddled with it for a few seconds, head turned sideways like a puppy dog, with a puzzled look...then I guess it finally sunk it that once again he was being thwarted, and this was by design, so he gave up!  YES!!Knocked off one star because this cheeeeeeeeep plastic people.  I'm actually shocked the 15 mo old did not just break it when he pulled on it.  Seems like it would have just snapped, but nope.  The house iPhones can sleep peacefully now.
-1	this didn't fit our toilet unfortunately.  We had to return it and find another product.  Not sure if it would have held up to my son's strength anyhow
+1	On the upside, I have no toys or rolls and rolls of toilet paper to fish out of my toilet.  On the downside, it's difficult for some adults to figure out and we've actually had a toilet unseated because someone REALLY had to go.  However, I find it easy to use on a regular basis, so just need to give guests a bit of training.
-1	Standard round toilet, nothing fancy. Even had the non skid mat that another reviewer recommended. Less than a minute after install and my toddler had the whole device off the toilet. Repeat install, trying every spacing with spacers and different positions within the allotted pie space in instructions. Same results. Wait for hubby to come home. Repeat. Luckily Amazon has a great return policy. Ordered the one that attached to tank and has an arm that comes down to seat lid. Toilet stays closed now. Fun to watch visitors try to open.
+1	Easy to use once you figure it out.  Asked a professional baby proofer what they recommended and they said this is the best.  My 18 mo old hasn't figured it out so it's working great.
+1	Added a picture to the product gallery. It took me a while to figure out how to attach it, but it's very simple. Seems quite sturdy as well!
-1	I purchased this for my bathroom and guest bathroom. While this does work when used properly , its opening is not very intuitive. What happened is that my husband never learned to use it, my guests could not figure it out how to use it ( i couldn't go into the bathroom and just open for them or teach them right?) and the cleaning lady never understood how to open it either. Thus, the device would always end up on the floor. Also i found it unsanitary because it attaches to the bowl rim, thus getting dirty itself....just not nice at all. I got another one that attaches to the top of the lid- don't remember the brand, maybe safety 1st. Anyways, i don't recommend this.
+1	After looking over all the other options, I chose this design because I didn't have to mess with the toilet lid bolts.  I am so glad I went with this one!  It was super easy to assemble and install.  I initially installed it wrong because I didn't read the directions correctly, but was able to reinstall it pretty quick.  My 18 month old has tried to get this open for months and still cannot do it, but I can do it with one hand no problem.
-1	Inside this package they give you spacers to fit the product to the toilet. Three spacers is too loose on the rim and four spacers is too tight. (The clamp won't fit over the top of the rim without snapping in half. The spacers fall off anyway.)It says in the directions that it'll work when slightly loose. Well, when it's slightly loose, it slightly POPS OFF the toilet. Isn't very useful when it won't even attach to the toilet.I refuse to spend extra money and time fitting adhesive or rubber onto the inside of this gadget. It's going back. I'll just close the bathroom door. It's free and guaranteed to work!Our toilet is a brand new American Standard--nothing out of the ordinary. Don't waste your time or money with this thing.
+1	Once you get used to this, you can operate it with one hand in the dark. That's a definite bonus with a commode seat lock!
-1	Don't bother buying this. It wouldn't stay on my toilet or keep it closed. It just kept falling off. Pointless.
-1	Does not stay on my toilet very well and it is easy to pull off.  My son is able to open the toilet still.
+1	Like the way is set up. Easy to install and very safe for kids and for parents step ahead of preventive an accident.
+1	great lock to keep our toddler from splash playwell pricedeasy to install and use18 month old hasn't figured it out yet
+1	I got this for my son and it works just like it say it will. I had to get another one for the other toilet.
-1	My one year old had no trouble figuring it out. It's neither sturdy nor intelligent in its design. I could not recommend it for the purpose it's being sold.
+1	The only toilet lock I could find that works with toilet seats that are not flat however, my 2-year-old has opened it when she pulls hard enough.
+1	We've had these locks on both our toilets since the baby was just over a year old.  He's now 29 months and he doesn't mess with the toilets.  I think there are 2 reasons for this.  We've had the toilets locked so long that it's never paid off for him to try to play in there and he can't get into it even if he tries.I have to get more, I broke one on accident.  Oops!  Considering the age of them I think that they've been a good value for us.
+1	If your child wants to get into the toilet, this lid will not stop him. For us, it is a deterrent. He tries a couple times and moves on to other things. But the few times he reeeeally wants into the toilet... he just pushed the thing to the back of the toilet and can apply enough pressure to force the latch open. It's pretty weak and won't save your phone from taking a swim if your kid is really motivated. My 14 month old seems to ignore the toilet a lot more now so I gave it 4 stars instead of 2 since it is at least working mostly.
+1	prevents our toddler from opening the toilet. we do have to tell guests how to use it because it's not intuitive to open.
+1	This isn't a high-end product. It a cheap white piece of plastic. But it does the job... keeps the lid down so my toddler cannot raise it. My only real negative besides it being a cheap piece of white plastic is that it's a bit unintuitive to others how to open it at first. Any adults visiting my home and I have to show them how to unlatch it.
+1	Love this not permanent so I can take it off after the &#34;stage&#34; no glue or any hardware.  Easily goes together fits any size toilet and very very secure.  Durable material easy to open lid (adults that know how to).Would buy this over and over again if needed but the one's I have will last forever.  Have already recommended to several friends.
+1	These are so easy to install and easy to use! We got one for each toilet and love them. My daughter (19 mos) goes up to it and tries to play with it sometimes, but she's never even come close to getting it open.
+1	Better safe than sorry. Easy to install. Totally toddler proof.
+1	I wish they could get a more precise fit so they don't move around on the toilet, but otherwise, my 18MO stays out of the crapper... finally.
+1	Personally I like it, easy to install and use. But I had to return because it didn't work on the shape of my toilet.
+1	Finally! after searching for a while and purchasing 2 other toilet locks . . . . I found one that fits my Toto! Yeah! no more hand washing in the toilet! Yeah!I even called Toto to ask them if they knew of a lock that worked on their toilets and they couldn't help at all. How disappointing. It was the reviews here on Amazon that helped me find the right lock.Once again, Amazon reviews save the day!
+1	My son loves to sneak in the bathroom and act like he is washing his hands in the toilet, not with this handy little thing now he just drums on it
+1	I've loved this item since day one of installing it. It is super easy to put in place and to use. My toddler is baffled on how to open it. Believe me this kid is strong! He has repeatedly yanked, pulled and tried in vain to get it open or break it off, all to no avail!! Now for some reason, this device is not just toddler-proof but also relative and maid-proof as well!! Many seemingly intelligent adults have found themselves utterly befuddled and frustrated with the workings of this device. At times I have found it yanked off the toilet in a desperate attempt to lift the lid with the device in place. HOT TIP: Lift up on both tabs at the same time. Wella....magic!!
+1	Thank goodness for the other reviewer that recommended using the rubber shelf liner to make this fit better - it is super snug and works great! No adhesive or other such attachments! We had another toilet lock that was much more complicated and used adhesive to attach to the bowl and the lid. When we got a thinner style of lid, the lock no longer fit. Due to this, I was looking for an option that has nothing to do with the lid thickness. This one fit the bill, and I decided to go for it despite the bad reviews. I think the rubber liner makes all the difference! I could see how this wouldn't fit snuggly or function without it, so I agree that it is something the manufacturer should include (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).This is extremely easy to operate once installed, and you can do it one handed. Just lift the two small side tabs up with two fingers and flop the lock part down. Easy!
+1	I had no problems installing this without even reading the instructions. It's been great now that I'm used to opening it and can do so with one hand. Really helps so I can let her in the bathroom without her trying to play in the toilet. She tries to work it off but so far it's not budging. Good price too compared to what I was looking at in the stores.
-1	I have never used any other toilet lid locks, but this is so hard to install I have never been able to use it. I have just resorted to keeping the bathroom door closed all the time.
+1	It is almost husband proof! But truthfully, it works well and easy to open (for an adult who reads the instructions first!) Did I mention how easy it was to assemble, and to keep clean.
+1	Works well and installation was easy.  My only beef is that the directions say it works best when places at the angles of "8 o'clock" or "4 o'clock" on the seat, but the child can easily push it to any other position while the seat is closed.  Even while doing that though, he's still not able to get it open, which is all I care about.Update: About 9 months after purchasing this product, it finally broke.  My son definitely abused it.  He snapped it off a few times and it landed in the toilet, after which I ran it through the dishwasher because it grossed me out to touch. So after 9 months it broke. For the price, I'd say I got my money's worth. I would be purchasing another, but hopefully my son will be potty training within the next few months (crossing my fingers!)
-1	Won't fit our standard round toilet. It stays on until you put some pressure on the lid trying to raise it. Either the lid snaps the thing open, or the whole thing just falls off in the floor. Tried both of the pieces it comes with for adjustment. Neither works! Will be looking for something else.
+1	Easy to install, and very easy to use. Kids learn to use them very quickly, but no too quickly. Works like a charm.
+1	Easy to use and install. A little loose/wobbly on my toilet, even with the size adjustments, but not in a way that makes it ineffective...yet.
-1	I didnt really want this product to begin with because it sounded like a germ catcher. Product wasnt that easy to install but sits on the toilet and is kind of large. We used it for a few weeks but got rid of it. We recommend with a door handle lock instead so the child cannot get into the bathroom.
+1	I use this to keep the toilet locked from my toddler daughter. It's a good product and does the job. It's also easy to install. She can still lift the toilet seat even with it on about 1/2 an inch, but it still prevents from anything or her hands from going into the toilet.
+1	This works great keeping my 1 year old out of the toilet.  I have had a few adult visitors who couldn't figure out the system and were able to just remove the whole thing.  I'm not sure how they did it, and my kiddo can't, so I'm keeping it.  But keep in mind it is possible to remove without really meaning to.
+1	It is a good product and works like it should.  It keeps my little boy from playing in or flushing toys down the toilet.
+1	Love these and wouldn't get anything else.  Product does what it is supposed to do and is well made. Thanks!
+1	This is a good toilet safety latch. The lid will come open some if you pull on it once latched, but in my experience not too much to be an issue. It is difficult for toddlers to undo, at least mine anyways. It's pretty simple for adults but it may take a few tries to get the hang of it. My husband installed it easily but I had trouble with the instructions which aren't very good. It's also easy to clean.
-1	I hated this toilet latch! It did not fit tight enough on our toilet. Would not reccomend. We have a brand new toilet, so I figured it would work, not so.
+1	Well worth the price. It has deterred my 1 year old from splashing in toilet water for several months now. It's easy to install and easy to use.
+1	This lid-lock works great.  I am giving it 4 stars because ours is very squeaky and seems loose, but it does the trick.  Easy to open and close.  Now that my baby is a toddler, he is more interested in yanking at it and figuring out how it works.  It has withstood the assault so far.
+1	I read some reviews suggesting that it is simple to just lift both toilet lid and seat I do not agree. There is a latch that actually goes inside the toilet bowl so that is not possible. My 15 month old son can not lift the lid and has actually lost interest in even trying. It is simple for me to open so no struggle when ya gotta go! I give this the full stars it deserves!
+1	After hearing about a 15 month old who fell into the toilet head first and could not pull himself out he died as a result. This occurred in the middle of the night. What a horrible accident. We have one installed in every bathroom and feel much more secure. This will help with toys being flushed as well! Great Idea a must have for every parent with a curious toddler.
-1	the unit did not work on either toilet, our daughter would attempt to lift the lid which caused the adjustment part of this to loosen, allowing her to open the lid the second time while this pos fell to the floor. pick another option!
+1	There is not a large selection first of all for this kind of product on Amazon. However, after seeing and trying out other brands I know that this one is the more favorable one.PROS: Easy to install, i.e. did it with my daughter watching me and trying to &#34;help&#34; within three minutes while not reading the directions. Parts do not hang into the toilet..gross. Easy to unlatch even with one hand, does not interfere with the actual use of the toilet. =), My toots can not figure how to open the lid, thus she now leaves it alone!CONS: Does leave a small amount of space, that if your child was very determined, might be able to slid you smart phone or small set of keys in. But this has to be a very determined child. Still kinda gross having this stuck to the toilet bowl, but a better choice compared with the other brand that stick more into the toilet and are hard to use.
+1	We have an old (1947) toilet that is round.  Our Toddler started playing in the toilet and I had to get a lock asap!!!  This one worked right from the start and we have been using it for a week now. Once I installed it correctly, it held firm to the bowl and has not moved around at all....we love it and feel more secure having it!
-1	This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product.  How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me.  This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite.  It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise.  In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)
+1	I bought this after my toddler's sons diapers got really smelly. I intitally had bought the Diaper Champ since I didnt want to have to buy refills. But for some reason, either the seal was weakening or something, the Diaper Champ did not work as well for an older baby (after starting solids and stuff). The nursery, especially on hot and humid days smelled horrible. So I went out and bought this. I didnt want to have to twist anything and I had gotten mixed reviews about the original Diaper Genie so I thought I would give this one a try. This definately does the trick. There is no smell in the nursery at all. You just have to push the diaper through the clamped door and the diaper falls through and the clamp shuts itself air-tight. A few things to note: 1)When the bag is getting full yes it is hard to push a diaper through and that is when you get hit by the smell. But it also makes me realize how effective it is. Of course when you get to that point, it is time to tie off the dirty diapers. 2) You get hit by the smell a little when you tie off the dirty diapers. Again, this was to be expected. 3)Even though the diapers are not in contact with the pail itself, the pail can get a little smelly. But when that happens, I use any type of air freshener, like Febreze or Oust or Lysol NeutraAir and air out the pail for an hour or two and it's like new. All in all, no diaper disposal system is going to be perfect and you may smell a little odor in certain situations. But this product does what it says and the nursery has not smelled since I bought this.
+1	1. You can open the lid with one hand, where as the original has a button that has to be pushed while you're opening it (take 2 hands). 2. You just push the diaper through the trap door, instead of having to push the diaper through the spring loaded hole and having to turn the "crank" on the top to seal in the diaper. 3. The unit opens in the middle, which is the top of the part that contains the dirty diapers, instead of having to open it from the bottom (tip the entire unit over and pull the chain of diapers out). 4. The cutter is much easier to use, no buttons to push, just slide the top of the bag through the razor and tie it off, instead of having to push the button and crank the dial on top and turn and turn until it finally cuts through, then having to unlock the cutter so you don't continue to cut the bag instead of twisting the diaper in. 5. Unloading a single tub of dirty diapers is MUCH easier than pulling out pearls of separately twisted diapers and trying to find the ends, gather them all up (touching everything to keep the diapers together) while carrying them to the trash.As far as the odor, I think they are about the same, both work pretty well. Someone wrote that the old style only holds about 30 diapers and the new style holds about 180, I find that NOT to be the case. Both hold about the same number of diapers before having to empty, and for me, that is about 20 of the size 4 diapers (or so).I over paid, $30. I found that I could have gotten it at WalMart for about $25, but I'm glad I got it. It sure makes changing baby a LOT easier for me.
-1	I have used at least 5 diaper genie systems from all editions. One thing that I find surprising is constant complaints that bags are expensive and passionate defenders of this product who justify 200$ or more per year spending with claims this REALLY DOES NOT SMELL.  Well, it does not- to you. After using this for 2 weeks you will get used to the smell, well, most of people will, and it won't smell.  After using genie in 5 different homes, in the one I was on a daily basis, as full time nanny, this did not smell. In homes where I was only as occasional nanny or weekend help, this thing stunk badly for few weeks and after I got used to it, it stopped smelling...I worked as preschool teacher for 2 years olds class and our big trash can did not smell bad to me, but after quitting that job and returning later to visit, I almost throw up after visiting bathroom were that can was. And we bagged all the diapers.And now about those complaints about the price. Yes, this is expensive. Like I said, you will spend about 200$ if you have 2 kids in diapers. Refills will last you 3 weeks tops. Claim that 270 can fit in one refill is only applicable if you use premie size of diapers but it cannot be any cheaper in my opinion. Look at average prices of brand name trash bags. Yes, brand name because genie bags are also brand name. They are about 4-5$ for 25 bags that can fit 33 galons garbage cans. Cans that most families use with more then one kid. So trash bags are not cheap. I know people are complaining about the refill cost, but many compare cost of this refill with Target brand trash bags. And you cannot compare those two. This is not a budget product.So in the end, you can buy this, you can use it with you own generic trash bags, there are instructions online for that. That is the only way I see it working, and yes smell won't go away, for that you have to take the diaper outside.
+1	We purchased the new Graco "hands free" diaper pail after our 4th child was born hoping that it would hold in the odor like our Diaper Genie did, unfortunately we wasted $49. We used the Diaper Genie on our first 3 children, after sampling others, and have always come back to the Diaper Genie.  It is the best in keeping odors in, just make sure you change it regularly and you'll love it.  The Diaper Genie II is better than the "twist away" style too.  I would difinitely recommend this product.
+1	I read many of the reviews for the Diaper Genie as well as the Diaper Champ and I ended up registering for the Diaper Genie II since it was more affordable and both had people complaining about similar things.  I am not disappointed at all with my Diaper Genie II, however, it is the only kind I ever used and I never had the original Diaper Genie with the twist-bags that other reviewers wish they had not taken away.The Diaper Genie II is easy to set up and to use.  You have to push the diaper through a spring loaded opening that locks the diapers in along with the smell.  I never had a diaper squirt out on my hand because of the force of pushing it through the spring-loaded door as others have complained about, but perhaps my daughter just doesn't have extremely soiled diapers due to her age (four months), but I can see that being an issue if you do have heavily soiled diapers.  I change the pail after about ten to twelve diapers and have not had an issue with the smell coming through.  We were just putting them in with our regular trash and THAT was a problem as you got a whiff each and every time you opened the garbage can.  It is much more practical than using your regular garbage can.  Lastly, it is very easy to cut the bags and load in more.I am a bit worried that when she is old enough to walk and get into things she can easily get into the top of the pail, but I doubt she would be strong enough to push through the spring-loaded door.  Overall, I am very happy with the Diaper Genie and it is much more affordable than others that are $40+.
-1	First off we have twins. We had one of the older styles, which it appears Playtex has stopped supporting for refills, so we changed to this Diaper Genie Essentials Pail. What a terrible design! Trying to stuff the soiled diaper into this thing you can and at times do get pee and poop on your hands. Why? Because the flawed design forces you to push the soiled diaper between two flexible gates and down into the actual catcher, which means the pressure from the flexible gates compresses the soiled diaper and squeezes the contents out. This system does not, like the previous version, hold or reduce the smell either. My suggestion? If you can find a better solution get it! This solution is NOT worth the stench nor the crap on your hands.
+1	When researching diaper pails for our baby, I'd heard a lot of negatives about the original Diaper Genie, but the reviews here were good about the new model, so I decided to give it a try. I've used it for 5 months now and have had no reason to try a different brand. The Diaper Genie II is easy to use, it keeps the stink in the bag, and the refill cassettes are widely available in retail stores. It's done everything I expected it to do.
-1	I accidentally broke my Diaper Genie Delux so I picked this one up not knowing the difference between the two. I HATE it. While the Delux has its own set of problems, I actually couldn't live without it. But this version is just terrible. First of all, it's smaller than it looks so I can only fix a few size 6 diapers in before I have to change it. But the worst part is that without the foot pedal, you have to SQUISH the diapers down into the Diaper Genie, and my hands always get dirty. I don't see the point in even offering this model for sale. I hate it!
+1	and bought a diaper trash system.  As a first time mom, I was pretty naive.  "I don't wanna waste money on THAT.  I'll just throw away the baby diaper trash every day".  As a matter of fact, I threw it away TWICE a day and the trash still reeked of a horrific stench, courtesy of poop my daughter generously expelled as a result of her growing and adventurous appetite for solid foods.  Just being in the vicinity of one poopy diaper caused gag reflexes.  So I purchased this one (off Craiglist for $10 bucks with extra refill) and since then, I am in heaven.  The bag holds plenty of diapers so that I don't have to throw it away daily.  Maybe every 3-4 days?  And the stench?  Completely gone.  I throw in a lot of soiled diapers AND keep the pail in the baby room and still no smell.  Previously, I left the garbage pail OUTSIDE the room.  The pail is easy to use and I dont have a problem with using it.  Of course I have yet to see how many days one re-fill will last and they do seem pretty expensive (hence the 4 star rating instead of 5), but its worth not having a wave of stinky poop violate my nose.  So Little Munchkin...hit me with your best POOP!!!
+1	I don't know how I ever made it without a Diaper Genie! This system ensures that the diapers do not smell. We loved it so much we bought one for upstairs, downstairs and for grandparent's houses. It is super easy to use--highly recommend that if you use disposable diapers to buy this product. On another note-the Diaper Genie Elite works even better!
+1	This is the second one I bought.  It keeps oder out really well until it starts to get full.  Very easy to use and refill.
-1	The Diaper Genie II and it's brother the Diaper Genie II Elite are barely related.  We bought a Diaper Genie II to supplement our Diaper GEnie II Elite.  It appeared as if the only difference was size - slightly smaller - and the lack of a foot pedal.  What we didn't realize was that the foot pedal was how the ingenious airlock system works on the Elite. On the regular Diaper Genie II, you have to push the diaper through the hole.  first, it takes quite a bit of pressure.  Secondly, you have to push it WITH the diaper - and you can imagine that you might get your hands dirty doing that.  So, we were disappointed as soon as we set it up and saw how it works - but it was too late to return the product. So now we're stuck with it.Updated ...We have been using it for a month and have gotten used to it. I'd still recommend the Elite II, but this product isn't bad for a 2nd diaper disposal unit.  You do get used to the amount of pressure required to push down a diaper and as new parents, we've learned how to roll up the diaper into a tiny, compact package.  It's been about a month and I haven't gotten my hands dirty yet.
+1	This is definitely a nice-to-have baby item, not a must-have. Though all families are different, we have gotten good use out of our Diaper Genie II. We only use it for dirty diapers, as we throw plain wet ones out with the regular trash. It contains the smell (except for a momentary whiff when you open the lid) and isn't an eyesore. Since we only use it for the dirty diapers, it doesn't fill up as quickly as it would if we used it for all diapers. The benefit to this practice is also that the liners last a LONG TIME.The lid took me awhile to get used to doing 1-handed. At first I had to use both hands, but I've finally figured out where the sweet spot is to push when I open it. Also, you really need to be sure to empty it before it overfills- or you will be squeezing everything to get the next diaper in, and may end up with a mess... if you know what I mean.All in all, I do recommend this product to new moms. I'm not sure if the new version, the Diaper Genie Elite II (with the foot pedal to open the lid) is any good, but I can vouch for this product!
+1	I've had my DGII for about a month now. The only issue I have with these is that when the refill cassettes get close to empty, the bag starts to loosen around the rim. Then, when you try to put a diaper in, the bag kind of goes with it, so you end up using more bag than you really need. Otherwise, I really like my Diaper Genie II. The only real stink you smell is when you get the full bag ready for the trash; inevitably, I end up penny-pinching by squeezing out excess air so as to use less bag. But I can easily take the thing outside the front door to do this, so it's not really a big deal. It sure beats my old diaper pail!
+1	These are really easy to install if you line them up how you want them and mark where you need to drill.  I like them because they stay in place, and if installed properly its easy for adults to open the cabinets, but too difficult for babies.
+1	Works great in locking the kitchen cabinets. Our 13 month old kept trying to open them for couple of days after I installed them and now has just given up :). I had to use a handheld drill to make holes in the wood before inserting the screws.
-1	The installation template is crappy, the screws are flimsy and one of them shattered into pieces within a week of installing. Would have been a really bad thing to have my son swallow one of the small sharp pieces of plastic. Stay away.
+1	kind of a pain to install but do prevent our toddler from getting into cabinets. stiff at first but with use become easier to push down to open a cabinet.
+1	Great product that hold up well over time and keeps the kiddo from getting into things and even prevents pinched fingers.
+1	My 11 month old twins get into EVERYTHING.  These cabinet locks work for us, in large part because of the reclosing protection feature that actually keeps the cabinets slightly open about an inch and a half (depending on installation).  This means everything to me, as the twins working together have still been able to get their little fingers caught in hinges and cabinets with other locks.  With the Safe-Lok, I actually always leave our cabinets open that inch, so that they can never open OR close the doors on each other.  I just make sure to never have anything in the cabinets that could fit through the small opening, which is pretty easy to remember.As for installation, it took my husband a half hour to install locks on all 8 bottom kitchen cabinets.  He definitely used a ruler, pencil and drill to do so, but with a modicum of engineering smarts these were no problem at all to install.
+1	We have used a few different brands for childproofing cabinets and drawers - this is definitely my favorite.Why its good:- Kids can't get in even after they have figured out the mechanism (it takes a fair amount of finger strength to press)- The lock open feature is great for preventing smashed fingers.  With twins even the other brands that keep them out of the cabinets do nothing to prevent accidental finger smashes.- Easy to install, better than other brands on alignment- very sturdy over timeWhats not so great:- people who visit the house always complain about how hard it is to get into anything.  I don't think it is so bad but I use them on a daily basis.- the larger tab size cuts into your usable drawer volume as it needs additional clearance to disengage the latch.  Drawer inserts, full drawers may cause additional difficulty opening.Despite the flaws, this is the best set of childproofing locks I have used out of several types and brands.
+1	This item has been in service for a couple months now without a hitch. They aren't as intrusive as other fridge latches since this is clear. My wife and I are very pleased with these, and would buy this same product again.
-1	It works great, unfortunately both the ones we've bought have lasted 3 months before breaking off. Hoping to find something more durable now, although I guess it's ok for the price.
+1	I love this fridge lock SO MUCH, I don't mind ordering another one cause mine is already peeling off 6 months later. No matter how hard my 1 year old son pulled, he couldn't open the fridge. And he pulled at it A LOT! And it took some getting used to (on our part as well) cause even I would forget it's there and yank at it hard. Still through the continuous abuse, it held up for 6 months. I'd say it was worth it and I'm getting another one!The next one should last longer cause now we already remember it's there so we try not to yank it and my son has given up trying! :)
+1	I am so happy with this product. It is so simple but works so well. I put it on our metal garbage can because our dog kept opening our garbage lid and leaving garbage all over our kitchen. This lock keeps the dog out! It is so easy to open, my 2 year old can still open the garbage can. And it barely cost anything! Note: You do need to put it on a flat surface. Our garbage can is rectangular shaped (not round) and has a 2" tall lid with no lip so it stuck really well for us.
-1	I installed this exactly as instructed.. my 2 year old walked up to it and unlocked it in mins! SOO I then took it off and installed it so that you had to push on the door to unlock it.. she figured that out the next day. I would have sent it back but the charge to return it was about the cost of the lock. This product is useless.
+1	does exactly what it's supposed to do. just be careful if they ever notice it's there. small children love to bend things the wrong way and this device will break if bent too far the wrong way. on the upside the adhesive lets go without industrial solvents.my favorite feature of this clip: it latches itself when you close the door.ours lasted 8 months before the youngin' realized it was there and started testing it.
-1	This survived all of 3 yanks from a not terribly insistent little girl. and I did clean and dry the surface prior to applying the adhesive as instructed. Good idea if it worked, but it does not.
-1	I have a toddler who just loves to sit in the refrigerator. After redirecting him from the refrigerator and many tantrums later I decided to get this refrigerator lock. I can't believe it has as many good reviews as it does. I wonder if people would update their reviews if they would feel the same way about it. We installed this Tuesday afternoon. By Thursday morning my son came up to me with the latch in his hand. The adhesive is poor. When I tried to reaatach it I could see why it so easily came off. My toddler does not have super human strength... it's a flimsy product. Don't bother. :-(
+1	This is the PERFECT toddler bed - it's inexpensive, it's sturdy, and it's absolutely adorable!  If you search the 'net, you'll find dozens of other rave reviews about this particular toddler bed.We just bought this a few weeks ago for our son's 2nd birthday.  He loves it!  It's close to the ground, and he can get in and out of it with incredible ease.Like some other reviewers said, the instructions were a little vague.  Like the pictures won't show you which way to put together each piece.  You need to think it through a little and make sure the holes for the side rails are both going the same direction, etc.  Just think ahead and anticipate what goes where, which isn't hard by any means.  If you've never put together furniture before, I can imagine it might be a little more difficult.But my husband and I having put together cribs, dressers, changing tables, etc, we found this one of the easier baby items to assemble!All in all, it's an awesome product, and I would definitely purchase it again!  Do NOT buy the cheapo ones at walmart, etc - those are poorly made, plus with amazon, you have the added benefit of no tax and FREE shipping, meaning you don't have to lug it out to your car and then to your house - they deliver it to your doorstep!I searched for hours for the best online deal for a toddler bed - this is it!  You won't find a better product for a better price!  Buy it and you won't regret it!Thanks amazon for yet another great buy!UPDATE 1/8/2010:We've had this bed for a year and a half, and it has held up FABULOUSLY!  As hard as our toddler can be on furniture (I'm sure you all know!!) I was surprised at how well it's held up.  He still fits great in it, and he loves that he has a bed sized right just for him.  :o)  A year and a half later, I would still definitely buy this again.  A really great toddler bed, especially for the price!!
+1	I ordered this for my almost 2 year daughter and it is gorgeous. Much better looking than in the picture.It is sturdy and putting it together was pretty easy. The hardest part was aligning the slats into the holes on both rails at the same time by myself. If I had waited and had somebody help it would've been a cinch. Otherwise it was super easy and didn't take long at all.The crib mattress fit perfectly, nice and snug. The weight limit is 50lbs but I have sat/lain on it and it held up fine although I wouldn't make a habit of it since I am 100lbs over the limit!I would definitely buy this bed again, it looks beautiful in her room.
+1	For the price and beauty of this product, it simply can't be beaten. I shopped for weeks for an appropriate rocking horse for my youngest. I wanted something that I could hang onto for a while even after she outgrows it, and I truly found it with this rocking horse.The info states that it is for an 18 month to 3 year old child and will accommodate up to 50 pounds. It arrived unassembled, in great condition with all wooden pieces and all hardware. It took my spouse approximately 20 minutes to assemble this horse. The pieces are quality and should stand up to years of abuse from my children. The kit also came with customer service info in case we needed help. Both of my children enjoy playing with the horse and they squabble over it.The horse is terrific. I only have minor criticisms.The horse's mane could have been attached a little better. A few more pieces than I expected have pulled out due to play. Also, the faux leather bridle over the nose slips around quite a bit and has to be put back into place. I also notice that the runners are a little short for good rocking action. The horse rocks but it is not as smooth and fluid as I expected.I think this is a fine addition to any child's playroom. I look forward to seeing my children enjoy it for the next few years.
+1	Cute horse, was a big hit at my friend's baby shower. It came missing one screw, but was easy to assemble.
+1	My 23-month-old daughter loves this horse. It's adorable, solidly built, and easy to put together; however, its mane and tail shed some yarn coming out of the box, and shed some more yarn just by being gently touched. Fix the mane and tail, and this would definitely be a 5-star item.
+1	My son (18 months) loves it; he rides him, feeds him (hahahaahahahahhaha) every day and plays and talk to him; it's adorable; recommend it 100 %
+1	I purchased 2 of these for twin grandchildren. These were very easy to put together. I am a 65 year young grandmother, and put both of them together in one evening. The instructions were a little technical, but with the pictures I found them to be excellent, even though I didn't know all the terms, I was easily able to figure them out. All you need is a screw driver, and a little muscle. They seem very well made, nice wood. They seem sturdy. They are very cute!
+1	It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse. Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is. I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years. When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three. Just keep the smaller stature in mind.
+1	After reading all the reviews, I thought I was getting a great product in the mail! Sadly, ours didn't do so well during shipping or it was poorly made from the start. It came with a bunch of dings,dents and scratches. I understand it will get that way with play-- but I expected it to be a quality product upon receipt. The biggest issue I found was with the packaging...it needed to be wrapped a little bit better. It is the responsibility of the product producer to make sure the product can withstand shipping.***UPDATE-- Amazon immediately responded and offered many options to rectify the situation. As always, I am VERY impressed with Amazon's customer service. We buy on a very regular basis from Amazon and their service is top notch...we are extremely loyal. I updated the # of stars to 4 because while the product was damaged, they offered to replace it.
+1	We bought this as a gift for a nephew. At the low price, I was worried it wouldn't be well-made or sturdy enough to last. I was wrong. After assembling this (which was quite easy, took about 20 minutes), the final product came out strong, sturdy, and great-looking. Everyone that saw it was impressed with its appearance. It will take wear and tear, the hair is surprisingly high quality, and our nephew loved it! Hard to find a long-term heirloom for under $100, but this qualifies for sure.
-1	We returned this gate. It opened very awkwardly. Was not worth drilling holes in the wall for. If you want a gate please invest in a more expensive one. You pay for what you get with this.
+1	For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item.  It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides.  (If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.)  I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area.
+1	WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL! This works like a dream. My son is a year old and it has held up since he started crawling at 4 months!
+1	Good gate, works well, very cheap.Probably works best in standard to large door openings.Not hard to install, once you understand the concept. We hung the hinge side following the instructions and adjusted the catches to where they needed to be, as it varies somewhat depending on the width of your door opening.One more tip is to use quick ties to keep the gate from sliding in and out when opening and closing. This makes it much easier to use the gate with one hand and keep it from swinging too far in the wrong direction.
+1	The cap does what it should, but it took a very long time to get here.  I'm a little spoiled by Prime, but it took well over a week.
+1	I dropped one of my caps on the ground and snapped the part off that the tube goes over.  Due to that I decided to order several extras and was glad to see that they cost less than $1 each.  These are the exact caps that came with my pump, so I have no complaints other than I wish Ameda made them a bit sturdier.
-1	This mattress was inexpensive and worked well for our first baby who was born in Oct of 2009. It fit perfectly into the DaVinci crib we had and I loved the waterproof cover.Our son only slept in his crib from the age of 6 months until he was 28 months and the mattress cannot be used for our second baby. It sags terribly and is no longer firm enough to be used safely with an infant.Very disappointing.
+1	This is a great mattress! I was so impressed at the packaging when it arrived (double-wrapped in plastic inside a box), and it was super light-weight, so I was able to unpack it easily. The mattress is firm and fits nice and snug inside the Graco Sarah 4-in-1 crib. We are very pleased!
+1	I like it enough. Daughter sleeps well on it, although the mattress is a little loud. I suppose that's good because it means it's waterproof.
+1	Great item. Baby sleeps well on it. Not too hard, not too soft. Just right would recommend to family/friends. Love it
+1	We purchased the DaVinci Twilight 6' foam mattress because of reading excellent reviews on other sites.  There was only one on Amazon when we decided to buy this mattress.  It arrived in a timely manner wrapped in just plastic, as some of the other reviews had stated.  I was concerned about this at first, but the plastic was heavy duty and the mattress was also wrapped inside in a thinner plastic.  There does not seem to be any damage or dirt on the mattress.  It fits perfectly in our DaVinci Kalani Crib, which is good as this is one of the mattresses recommended for it.  So far it seems to be a good mattress, though one side of the mattress in one corner appears to be a bit sunken in.  We will see how the mattress really works once our Baby arrives in August and can try it out.  I will repost more information at that time.
+1	As an FYI, the product dimensions Amazon has for this product are incorrect.  It is NOT 33" wide.  The correct dimensions are found in the product images.  The indication of 33" is misleading and may prevent people from buying this product.  The product is a standard size and regular crib sheets will fit.  Hope that helps someone.I haven't used the crib/mattress yet, but it seems like a standard, firm, coil free mattress, hoping that it lasts us awhile.
-1	It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)
-1	I am disappointed with this mattress. It has cracks allover and unfortunately after a year of using I have to replace it with new one.I would not recommend it to anyone.
+1	Firm, good size, fit out pack and play. It's waterproofed and easy to clean. Very light to pick up. No complaints.
+1	Excellent product; I thought that it is a little bit too hard but I guess this is how it suppose to be for a newborn
+1	After making the purchase, I read bad reviews about the product, try to cancel the order but it was impossible. When the mattress arrived breathe relieved that my baby would not sink in it. I thinkit will serve for one year.
+1	The mattress is still wrapped in plastic as the baby will be born in May and my child care will begin in July.  It fits the DaVinci crib thank goodness.
-1	I ordered the Da Vinci crib, which is still backordered, and got the free mattress to go with it, so I figured, even if it is crap (which it appears to be) it was free.  I will be using this as the mattress my baby will sleep on when we visit the grandparents.Compared to the Serta mattress I have for home this mattress is way too squishy; it does not feel very supportive, so it will be great for the occasional sleep.Oh and when it was delivered, it was just in a plastic bag, no box, so who knows what could have been placed on it while in the truck.
+1	I purchased this since it matched my daugher's crib. Very heavy, and arrived well packaged, with no scratching or damage. A little difficult to put together with one person, taking about an hour and a half. The only concern that I have, is that each of the drawer fronts have popped off at one point, since having clothes put in. We have fixed this, and it has not happened since, but makes me wonder if as the clothes get heavier, it may not hold up as well.
+1	This dresser was hands-down the easiest furniture assembly I've done in the past several years. All the parts (screws, etc.) were there, all the holes were well-drilled and centered, and everything fit together just as it should. I did nearly all of it by myself, in about three hours. The finished dresser is beautiful and has plenty of storage for all of my daughter's clothes. I would highly recommend this dresser!
+1	It seemed people were commenting about needing slats or issues with the rails once the crib was converted to a bed.  I converted into a full size bed.  But, so the height wouldn't be too much for my 2yro son, I explored options to just use a mattress.  The mattress company have this special board that fits perfectly and does NOT require any additional support.  It's like a box spring, but only a flat version.  It was about $70...it is a fantastic choice to keep the mattress on well and in place.  So, I have had NO issues with the rails.  Now, the instructions and getting the crib changed were a different story.  The crib instructions were a little better than what came with the rails.  And, these do seem a little higher priced than they seem they should.  I'm happy though.
+1	DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - CherryI bought one for each of the matching cribs I bought. Both are still in their boxes. babies are still too small.Should be a great set up.
+1	We haven't actually used this yet, but purchased it for my daughter's crib along with purchasing the crib. Like the crib itself, the kit looks sturdy and well-made. It comes with all the necessary attachments.
+1	Purchased this 4 years after purchase of DaVinci crib.  Relatively easy to put together; took my husband and I about 45 minutes.  Wanted to make sure everyone knows you must have a box spring with this bed frame.  Mattress will not be supported otherwise and in addition, you will lose your warranty on the mattress if not supported properly.  We purchased a low-profile box spring (cuts about 3 inches from regular one) and my 3 1/2 year old can just barely pull herself up on it.  So she will use a step stool for another few months.  It's a beautiful bed frame for a child's room.
-1	When I purchased the kit, I did understand from other reviews as well as the picture, that this &#34;kit&#34; simply consists of two rails. As previous reviewers had recommended we too went to Home Depot and got five 6&#34; thick slats cut to 52&#34; width to provide support for a box spring and mattress.Granted that cost us only ~$20 but it was something that should have been included in this kit saving customers time,effort and additional charge considering that they are already paying quite a hefty sum for two rails.After my son was born, I recommended the Da Vinci Kalani crib to two other friends but definitely will not be doing so in the future! And when looking to buy a second crib for new baby, I will definitely look at other convertible crib options which do include the complete kit and slats in the price of the crib itself!(Hint: check Costco)
+1	These rails turned the bed into a full size bed... but as others mentioned, you still need a support system. First we thought that a box spring would be sufficient, but it wasn't. The whole set (box and mattress) fell to the floor while my son was in bed....I just ordered a metal support system from[...]. Hopefully it will do the trick. I really like the full bed and I want it to work out....Here's the link for the support system. Hopefully it will help somebody...[...]
+1	These were purchased to go with our crib. Ordered now in case not available at later date. Once used will update review. They appear solid.
+1	Got this hamper for our nursery. It is solid (really a nice option since that's what I was looking for.) Won't tip over easily and shuts tight. However, I was surprised at how small it is. I think my washer could probably do at least 1.5 of these in a load (if not 2) I'd compare it to a small laundry basket in size. Will be good - help me to wash more frequently - but if you are looking for a basket that will hold lots of stuff - might not be a good fit.Well made and otherwise quite pleased.
+1	Adorable and has held up well over the past 10 months. The liner for the inside is easy to remove and replace so I just pull the whole bag out when full and carry it to the laundry room. Perfect for a baby/small child's room!
+1	These locks are perfect for the stage of toddlerhood that we're entering.  These locks were easy to install (make sure to predrill holes for the screws so as not to split the wood) and are a durable plastic.  There will certainly come a time when our daughter will be able to figure these out, but for now, they do the trick.  They're also not too cumbersome for adults to use frequently to get into cabinets.
+1	Great for keeping my daughter out of the cabinets.  I cannot rotate the lever to disengage it though.  This MAY be due to improper installation, I don't know.  It isn't much of an issue since right now they are serving the purpose of keeping my daughter out!
+1	I did alot of research for locks and this lock works well. We are in a rental unit at the moment so I was looking for something that wasn't too permanent and these locks fit the bill. My daughter, 13 months will try and open a cabinet and when she realizes that the door will not open then she will give up and crawl away. She can look inside partly which I do not mind because it is just enough to appease her and not get frustrated.
+1	Works how it is suppose to. Keeps the baby out of the cupboards. He is 15 months and he hasn't figured out how to open them yet so that's a good sign!
+1	Got a bunch of these to secure some overhead cabinets that have some pretty heavy potential projectiles inside. This is half because we're expecting and half because we live in earthquake country. I know these locks are marketed as being for keeping babies out, but they seem just as fine at keeping things in. When installed properly they definitely stop the door from being opened completely, and though they at first seem a bit flimsy the plastic arms are pretty tough.As an added plus, the arms can be rotated if you want to disable the locks, and they can be positioned in quite a few ways. Just from playing around with these, I'm pretty sure they'll work with most cabinets and drawers. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:1. You do need to drill holes and put screws in. If your cabinet doors are really thin, this could be an issue. If they're made of something other than wood, it probably isn't a good idea.2. Due to the fact they're designed to fit a wide range of furniture, there's no real 'guide' for how to install it. You pretty much have to hold them in place and eyeball the angle and positioning, bearing in mind that you do need space to drill holes and screw it in. I found this was easier said than done and ended up having to move the first set more than once.3. The plastic seems to 'settle' a bit after a while. It's not much, but I noticed with one set that I had installed them so they could close without pushing the arms in. A few days later, they couldn't anymore- the arms seem to have moved.4. There is little margin for error in positioning. The stops are pretty shallow, and you need to position the arms so they will impact the rear of the stop but slide off the front. You have perhaps a quarter of an inch of leeway in either direction. When tied in with #2 this makes proper installation pretty difficult.5. There's no spare parts. Lose or strip a screw, you'll need to go get a new one. Additionally, the screw heads seem a tad narrow for the plastic molds, if you screw them in too hard they'll actually embed in the plastic.Despite these issues I like these locks- they function properly and were inexpensive. Installation was a bit of a pain, but it's not like I'm going to be doing this every day. They're pretty easy to get used to as far as everyday functionality, and if you can't stand them for some reason you can always disable them.
+1	Received this blanket as a gift and was impressed by its size and quality. It wasn't until we began using it that I truly realized its value! The material is lightweight and strong. Due to its size and the quality of the material it serves its purpose quite well. Very pleased.
+1	I wish this blanket wasn't so expensive! It makes for an excellent baby shower gift.It is a perfect receiving/swaddling blanket.  Most of the cheaper ones are too small for when the baby grows past a few months.  Due to its size, it lasts much longer, is much softer, and is a great product. It keeps the baby warm and secure, and has a nice snug fit. It does not come undone when the baby moves around.  You can fold it to adjust for the size of baby when they are small, and then adjust as they grow.BUY this for your friends and family! They will thank you.
+1	This receiving blanket is just great - it's large, soft, comfortable and totally durable. We have been using it since our baby was born (for 2.5 months already) and it looks and feels like new. Unlike some cheaper receiving blankets, it's very thick and has a real soft touch.
+1	I love everything Swaddle Designs!  Every item I have ever gotten from this company has been super soft and great qaulity.  It also helps that they are adorable and a bit different from the typical cheesy baby designs.  My nursery is green and brown so I fell in love with the look first, but the quality is just as awesome as the look.
+1	We have several blankets by swaddle design.  The are wonderful.  The wash beautyfully and maintain there shape and softness.  They get softer with washing.  The size is generous and is both a great swaddler for the cold days and will be a great light blanket when the baby gets older.  Love these.
+1	We used this blanket from day one in the hospital, it was so much easier to swaddle our little one in this rather than the rougher flannel blankets the hospital gives you.  We had a hard time swaddling with the standard hospital blanket but this one is the perfect size.  Baby was swaddled and soothed in no time.  It is flannel, so can be a little warm for the warmer spring/summer weather.  We used this blanket in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block video and have had great success.  It has already been washed several times and definitely holds up!  We loved it so much that we ordered a second one.
+1	Love love love these Blankets!  They wash up well & are so practical.... they can be used in multiple ways.  I've given them as gifts and everyone loves them.  Much larger than the average flannel receiving blankets that you buy in the stores.  Everyone should have at least two!
+1	I love this blanket. ALthough I could never actually swaddle my son (he hated it), we use thsi all the time for his regular blanket. I use the green for the car, cover him in his carseat. Its light enough that I can double fold it and it fits nicely around him. We use the other on the floor when we have him on the carpet. They fold up nicely.I have washed both of the blankets hundreds of times and they have not faded. They are super soft and are my favorite blankets!
+1	I bought the flannel blanket and this marquisette one just to test them out before I order more. The flannel is much heavier, much nicer, very soft and the size of these blankets can't be beat. My two year old sleeps with these at night and it is just big enough to cover his shoulders to his feet.The marquisette blanket is much thinner, more like a gauze material. Kind of scratchy and completely see through. I'll keep it for swaddling a Texas baby in July/August but if you aren't looking for something extremely light, spend the extra few bucks and go with the flannel.
+1	I bought this gate for the top of the stairs and for me its been money well spent.Its easy to install and quite sturdy.The auto close feature works well though it is a bit loud when it closes.The opening is a bit narrow but overall it is doing what it is supposed to.
+1	Not easy to install in my opinion (and I am an Ikea installation junkie). However, sturdy and well built.Operation is not too easy, but a five-year-old can do it after a little training. It does take a little effort lifting the gate when opening every single time (that annoys my wife).It is expensive, and the extensions are unnecessarily expensive (why!), but you get your money's worth.
+1	This is by far one of the best purchases I have ever made.  The gate is fantastic.  It is so secure that adults can't even figure out how to open it (really funny to watch)!  I will admit that it took a couple of tries to get it tight enough but once it is in place - it doesn't budge!  The only thing I don't like but understand it is necessary is the very loud click it makes when it closes.  It confirms that it is locked but if my son is sleeping, the click can be heard in his room.  Oh - make SURE you following the directions completely - I accidentally cut the straps off from the beginning which is why my installation took longer.
+1	It closes on it's own, which is perfect for my needs.  It is heavy duty construction.  The wall posts can be screwed in but unlike another gate I purchased, it came with double sided tape as well.  Installation was pretty easy.  Auto-close works fine so far.One note though:  The gate requires you to unlatch and lift, which if you have older people in the house it may not be desirable.  My mom finds is hard to use.
-1	I have this gate with 2 extensions to fit my 43&#34; opening. With the extensions the gate seems wobbly. The lock mechanism doesn't actually lock and if you lift it it will easily come open. The plastic pieces don't seem like they'll hold up for too long.  I would recommend the  Summer Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze  instead. I have that one on another opening and it is strong and sturdy! Very well built and I don't worry about my toddler opening it or it possibly falling!
+1	We purchased this to place around our brick hearth, in advance of our child learning to crawl. This product has not been tested by our infant yet, but it's probably safe to say that he will be able to pull this loose. That said, my take on this product is that it is meant to cushion the edges of the hearth in the event he were to fall towards the hearth. I don't think this product was intended to be repeatedly pulled at or played with by infants, so I was a bit surprised to see so many reviewers complain that their children could easily pull this loose. Of course they can pull it loose! It's foam adhered to an extremely porous surface with some double-sided adhesive! My question is why are these folks letting their children play with the material that was installed specifically to protect their children from an area that was dangerous enough to begin with that it required said padding to be installed?? THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOOD PARENTING THAT WOULD TEACH YOUR CHILD THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE OFF LIMITS.As for the product installation, it was easy enough. I found it helpful to place each adhesive/velcro strip so that it would make contact only with the brick itself, and avoided placing where it would have to adhere to the mortar, since the mortar on our fireplace hearth is slightly indented and thus below the level of the brick, where the strips could more easily make and maintain contact. After letting set for 12 hours, I did attempt to remove the padding to see if the bottom velcro strips would remain adhered to the brick. It didn't. Again, this is not a huge issue, because I'm not really sure why we would want to temporarily remove the padding, leaving behind 2 dozen little velco strips on the hearth. All in all, I'm pleased with the appearance and installation of the product.
+1	I was  worried about putting this hearth guard down because I didn't think it would stick (I've had trouble with corner guards staying on)... but this comes with heavy duty velcro stick ons.  The velcro is hard to pull apart so I think it will be difficult for my son to figure out.  The pad is very cushiony and I'm sure it will serve it's purpose.
+1	I still supervise my toddler closely by the fireplace, but this foam gives me a little piece of mind.  If she falls, I know that I've softened the edge of my brick hearth to prevent a trip to the ER.  I have never had problems with her pulling it off (she knows she is not supposed to play with it), and I have removed it and moved to a  new house, and it still sticks just as well to the new hearth.  I'm very happy with this product.
+1	This is a great safety item for any home with small children!  It is both functional and, dare I say, attractive with the right color/brick combo.  It provides a great peace of mind that a slip near the hearth won't turn into an ER visit with x-rays and stitches.It is held onto the hearth with double-sided tape and I have read on other sites that reviewers have listed this as a major drawback.  And I must admit that my 4 year old can pull it off if he tries.  The simple solution there is, of course, to teach him not to do it!  Even my 16 month old has figured out that it is a no-no.  So, I do not consider it a con at all.
-1	We purchased Kidkusion Hearth Kushion (Taupe) expecting it to adhere to a hearth. But, no! We followed instructions to the T, but as soon as our 14-month-old granddaughter inspected the "kushion," she removed all of it and carried it around like a new-found toy. We might try applying the Seal 'N Peel caulk (as recommended by another customer); however, if this product were any good, additional material and labor would not be needed. This is the first item purchased through Amazon that I have rated so poorly.
+1	This padding works great, and has a nice fit. The velcro that comes with it is poor. I had to use silicon caulk to keep it down because my 10 month old kept pulling it off. The silicon works well. She doesn't even try to pull it off anymore. It has definitely saved us from a few accidents though.
+1	I was skeptical to purchase this product because I didn't know if it would stick to our granite hearth however it works GREAT! My little guy can't pull it off and it blends in well and looks neat.  Definitely glad I took a chance!
+1	Perfect for our hearth and little toddler.  Easy to put on, easy to adjust size, and great for little heads.  We bought 2 sets.  One for the top corner and edges and one for the bottom edge.
+1	We are very pleased with this product.  It provides a great cushion to coffee table edges and looks reasonably good.  The 2 sided stick tape it comes with is not great, so you will likely need to use heavier gauge (foam) 2 sided tape to keep your little one from pulling it off.  The corner pieces are good too however even the 2 sided foam tape that we used to try to keep our toddler from pulling them off didnt work; we ended up using heavy duty glue (Gorilla glue) to keep them on, which did the trick.  We like this product since it is a good match to our brown wood coffee table.
+1	Very easy to install keeps my little one safe. Will buy another for my other fireplace. I would recommend to anyone with little tots.
+1	Pros:Within 30 minutes of installing this, our 17 month old fell right on the corner.  She got up right away and kept playing, no marks or crying.  Bottom line is that it works, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.Cons:- I thought it would be bigger.  The depth towards the fireplace is okay, but it isn't very deep towards the floor. ...not sure if I explained that right, but basically it doesn't cover as much as I'd prefer.- I can't leave my baby alone near it for a second or she'll rip it off.  And half the time it rips the whole velcro off the brick instead of leaving one side as it should.
-1	I do not recommend this product. The sticky Velcro did not stay attached to my brick fireplace and my 8 month old son was easily able to pull it off. I threw this away about 2 days after I got it.
+1	I got this bib to use at my daughter's 1st birthday party. It worked like a charm. The cake stayed on the bib and not her. :) I also have the regular sized bibs from this company. All their bibs are great and wipe or wash well! Worth the money cause they last unlike the others.
+1	My daughter is 20 months old and loves to do it ALL herself...this bib is a lifesaver, and an outfit saver.  The pocket is perfectly placed and the shoulders are wide enough to protect her sleeves.  If only I'd bought this a year ago...
+1	We liked the smaller version of these bibs, and now that our son is eating more things and getting messier, the extra coverage because of more length is great in the supersized ones!  This keeps our pants cleaner than before and we love that the bibs are made of safe materials!! Great product!
+1	We use this every day. I love that it covers her entire lap! Might even buy another one. Easy to clean, too.
+1	This bib is the perfect size to use for every meal, nice to throw in the diaper bag, cleans off easily, can throw in the washer when it gets really bad.  Love it!
+1	This bib is great for any toddler. We used the Bumkins starter bibs and the sleeved ones a bit when our daughter was first starting to eat, but now that she's 2.5 and really needs more lap/chair protection than shoulder and arm protection, this is an amazing product. We've used our bibs at every meal since she started on solids at 4 months old. They've held up super well through lots of wipedowns, hand washes, and even machine washes. The velcro on one is starting to come off, but can easily be sewn back on.I found this to be the best of all the Bumkins bibs we've got. It provides more coverage than the other bibs, as not all food lands conveniently in the pockets (which don't stick out a ton to catch more food).I've no hesitation in recommending it to other parents.
+1	Great bib - we use it a lot in the car since it's long and keeps the car seat a little cleaner.  I wish the material was a little stiffer on the pocket because it tends to collapse and not catch the crumbs.  Would buy it again, though.
+1	I've always loved Bumkins bibs but as my daughter got older, the bibs got smaller and her messes got bigger.  This Bumkins bib saved many clothes from being stained and covered in food.Even my daughter loves this bib.  We hang all our bibs up and she goes straight for this Supersized bib whenever she's hungry and hands it to us to place around her neck.  Even she doesn't like spilling her mess on her shirt and pants.Details:The single food pocket on this bib is slightly larger than theBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-PackThe bottom half is generously wide and can cover a lot and works great in restaurant high chairs.  The only difficulty you might experience is if you're still using a high chair with a snap-on tray.  Since this bib is so large it will make a tight squeeze.  However with a little tug here and a pull there it will still work.This bib has saved me soooo much time cleaning up after soup spills and spaghetti spills.
+1	I purchesed these bibs because the reviews were great. I totally agree. This bibs are really nice. At first I thought these bibs were thin and were not going to catch anything. But they do a great job and wash up nicely. The Dr Seuss theme is really cute. Everyone comments on them.
+1	These have been great durable bibs.  My only complaint is they are a little to big.  I am still able to use it but sometimes food goes through my son's neckline.
+1	These are the best. So easy to clean. If they get wet it wont transfer to your baby's clothes. The pocket is good. Overall these are the best bibs!
+1	Baby chews on it while baby food (stage 2) and water just slide off and get on clothes and high chair. Maybe it's better for older babies/children.Otherwise, a great bib. Soft and shiny, dries and cleans easily.
+1	Sweet Caroline I love these bibs!  The pocket at the bottom is a must or else baby ends up with food all over her.  You can rinse these off in the sink or throw them in the washing machine (I hang them dry, though) and they keep their shape and don't start unraveling.  Well made, sturdy, and awesome!  Yay bibs!
+1	I have had these bibs for about 3 years now.  I have 4 of the Bumkins bibs total, (one I bought on it's own and then the 3 pack here).  I left one bib at my parents house for when my daughter eats there, and the other 3 have been cycled through at our house for almost 3 years now.  My daughter is 3 now, so she started using these when she started eating at around 6 months old.  She now just uses them occasionally if she is eating something really messy (she hates to make a mess of her pretty dresses).  These bibs really look great and show no signs of wear.  Sometimes I've wiped them clean but other times I've thrown them through the washer.  A couple of times they have accidentally been tossed into the dryer as well and I have had no issues with them.  The Velcro is great and they cover a substantial amount of space on my daughter.  The material is great because they are soft but easily wipe-able.  I also love the little pocket for collecting food.  I don't feel the need to try any other bibs because these are so wonderful. The price isn't bad either for how much use you will be able to get out of them.  You really can't go wrong with these bibs.
+1	These bibs are very easy to clean and have nice coverage.  Cute patterns.  I will absolutely be buying these again.
+1	These are lightweight and great to bring along in your diaper bag as it folds up very small. It's also waterproof.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a generous Velcro strip so you can adjust to your baby's neck size.  What I find from a lot of bibs is that I can't adjust it any smaller and the food ends up on the collar.  When you put this on baby, it also covers part of the shoulder area so if he rubs his face against his shoulders, you're still covered!  It's the little things that make moms appreciate this bib!
+1	We received the same set of bibs when my first son was born in 2009. We still use them 2 of them on regular basis. However, I decided to order new ones and to my surprice they are still on the market!I recived it quickly (thanks to Amazon!), but noticed that the material they were made of is a little differnt this time. Not as soft as it used to be.I wouldn't be so sure if I didn't find one brand new bib from 2009 a day before I received this order.Otherwise, I highly recommend these bibs to anyone! They are the best!
+1	What is good about this SuperBib:LightweightCan wipe off or washGood size to cover growing babyVelcro closure that goes on well and is a nice size for those cute little short necks.
+1	These are the best bibs ever. We have a variety of types of bibs that we were given at baby showers and these are the best by far. They don't get grimy like the other ones. It helps tremendously to be able to put the bibs in the wash.The only con may be if your child tries to yank their bib off on their own - velcro tab may not do much for you then. That said, my 19 month old yanks his bib off at the end of meals but it takes a LOT of effort.If I had a list of &#34;must have&#34; baby items for every mother these bibs would be on it!
+1	I love the coverage these bibs provide, especially on the shoulders. They are also easy to rinse and reuse; laundering is only needed after a few uses. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the neck does not fit well enough on my son to keep all the food and moisture from getting onto the tops of his shirts. If I put an absorbent bib underneath, though, he is usually dry and clean at the end of a meal.
+1	So we had a playdate with a friend and her baby and she accidentally left the one she was using for her son behind. I used it once and I decided to buy them for my son immediately. He despises his regular bibs all of the sudden and I wasn't about to let him wreck every piece of clothing in his closet as a result. He seems to dig these, and they give good to great protection against food dropping on his lap when he self feeds. Love!
+1	These bibs are nice and big, stay on, clean up easily, and you can put them in the washer.  Perfect.
+1	These are the BEST waterproof, easy-to-clean, bibs ever. We've had them for several months and use them daily with no issues at all. They wash very well in the laundry, too. My son loves to check out all of the patterns when I put these on him - it's really cute to see his reactions. :-)  We won't feed him solids in any other bib (we use soft ones for when he drinks milk). Love this brand and highly recommend!
+1	These bibs are great for my 1yr old daughter. It covers a large area, any spills she makes usually goes right in the bottom pocket of the bib, and it is very easy to wipe and clean. I use these bibs everyday for multiple foods and after about 4-5 months, the top of the bib started to fade as though the color was rubbing off. No big problem, just an observation. Also, my daughter loves to pull bibs off when she doesnt want them on anymore and these bibs are fairly harder to pull off, so I'm pretty thankful for the tough velcro. I would recommend these bibs.
+1	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!
+1	I've tried a lot of different bibs and felt resigned that none would do a great job of keeping the kiddo as clean as a bib should be able to do. Thank goodness I got one of the Bumkin SuperBibs in a recent CitrusLane box! After just a few uses, I knew I needed to order a set from Amazon. I got the three pack of Keith Herring print bibs and just love them.These bibs do a great job of keep food off of the kiddo. They have great coverage. They are wide and long (for a 10 month old at least). That they are flexible makes it easier to cover the kid. The neck also stays relatively clean because I can get a good fit with the velcro without choking him.I am a convert and can't recommend these bibs enough.
+1	These are great bibs. I have been using them for about 2 months - since my son started eating solids. They have caught most everything that didn't make it into his mouth and have cleaned up easy. I would recommend rinsing them when your child is done eating, as the food comes right off and no extra scrubbing is required. I have put these in the wash twice for a deep cleaning after traveling and not being able to rinse them right away and accidentally put them in the dryer once. They have held up fine, but I don't do it regularly. For daily use they get washed by hand.UPDATE: Now that my son is 13 months old and eating mostly cut-up table foods, these bibs aren't all that great at catching times. They do mostly protect his clothing and the high chair straps, but the pocket is pretty much useless for catching items. There is not real way that it stays open, so it stays pretty much flush against the bib and catches nothing. It is not such a big deal that I have tried anything else. Besides, the dog likes the extra treats that aren't caught and make it out of his high chair! :)
+1	these bibs are awesome. We use them everyday to feed our baby. The shoulders are wide enough that it protects from food getting on her clothes. The front pocket is great at catching food that falls and liquid that drips down. We've never really had a problem with her clothes getting dirty underneath these. They seem to be waterproof and it works pretty well. They wipe off really easy and they dry super fast. Overall these are excellent I would definitely recommend.
+1	These bibs are cute, fit well, catch food well, wash well, and are great overall.  We use them everyday on our son.
+1	My daughter and I really love these bibs. I wish I would have bought these sooner. They are machine washable and easy to clean. I recommend these to all my friends with kids.
+1	I love the Dr. Seuss designs on these Superbibs. They are gender neutral and very cute. The bibs can be wiped clean in between uses and hung to dry. By the next time you want to use them, they are ready to go! I do throw them in the washing machine from time to time and hang dry, to clean off the food that doesn't completely come off by handwashing. Highly recommended. The are expensive but worth the price and hold up well, and you don't end up scrubbing baby food out of clothes!
+1	These are the best bibs in on the market!  We've been using and laundering my sons set of Dr. Seuss Bumkims for two years now, and they still look brand new.You can machine wash and dry, which is what I usually do, but you can also hand wash them very easily and they dry in no time at all.  They come in so many cute designs and I love how small they fold up for travel.I have a newborn daughter and purchased her a set while I was still pregnant, as I knew it was all I would ever use later on down the line when she is able to eat solids.Don't bother wasting your money on anything else, just get these.  They're so reasonably priced on Amazon for how good they are and the use you'll get out of them!
+1	My son hated stiff bibs and would try to rip them off immediately.  These are our favorites.  They fold up very small for taking with you, and are very simple to wash.
+1	Have had these over a year and still going strong, even after innumerable washed in the washing machine. I have a feeling I will never be purchasing any more bibs!
+1	I bought these for my daughter 3 yrs ago when she started eating solids and bought again for my son who's now starting.  I think the material is actually better than before.  A little stiffer which is good for keeping its shape.
+1	These bibs are great!  Cleans really easily.  Wash, flip and dry.  The pocket does a decent job of catching food from our messy eater.  It's lightweight so very easy to bring when we're out.We've also tried the bjorn one and love this one much more.
+1	I love these bibs.  They work well for catching food - lots of good coverage but still fit nicely.  They easily wipe down and launder up nicely.  I highly recommend these.
+1	After using cloth bibs for a month, I bought this bib and have been pretty happy with it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the velcro part needs to allow the bib to be tighter. The food my son eats slips down his neck because I can't make the bib any tighter. I also wish the bib was longer. The bib is still great to easily wipe spills when my son is done eating. I also like that there is a pocket at the bottom to catch spills.
+1	These are nice and large for when my daughter spits liquid peas everywhere.  The pocket is handy.  Lovely patterns too.
+1	As others have stated, these bibs are great!  They're larger than the typical cloth ones, they're water-proof, and they clean up easily so I'm not washing a load of bibs every week.  Plus, you only need one pack of these since they dry so quickly, as opposed to 20+ of the cloth ones!  Tip: dry them with the pocket inside out to get the pocket to stay open more easily during feeding time.
+1	This is the best bib we've found. Highly recommended, but even with regular washing you'll want to replace it every 6-9 months as it grows mold inside the seams. We just bought three more since they are still a great deal if you have to replace them every 6-9 months. Very happy.
+1	This was my 2nd bumkins bibs purchase, and these ones are a little bit thicker than the girly 3 pack version we first purchased. Both have their purpose, but really they are the best bibs! So easy to clean, and they actually catch a ton of food (vs. others with catchers that seem to miss food as it falls)
+1	4 Stars because they did their job but the little one just got tried of them and wouldn't wear them any longer. Nothing wrong with the bibs themselves, just with the little girl that wouldn't keep them on. I would recommend them because while she had the bibs on they did their purpose of keeping the top half of her clothing clean.
+1	These are nice bibs. I love bumkins bibs for their quality and durability. I bought the jr. size bibs for my little one thinking it was a gimmick to have to buy bibs in different sizes. I think these particular bibs would've suited my guy in the beginning and that they are great up to a point. They are quite small when compared with the jr. bib but they do fit around the neck to ensure less crumbs and mess hit the t-shirt. The jr bib failed to do this b/c my guy was too small so I used to put a second infant bib underneath which avoided that issue. These bibs can fit 6 mos-2 yrs but I think they are becoming a little too small for my 16 month old in that he makes bigger messes with all the food he tries (my guy is not that big either, 24 lbs). Less bib means less coverage but they do a great job otherwise.They are soooooo easy to clean. I bought several to have in rotation. I just rinse them after the meal and I set them aside to air dry, then reuse. They really are odor resistant (to a point) and the pockets work ok at preventing crumby messes.all in all, a great product! (no PVC and very eco-friendly which is a huge + to me!)
+1	How do you review a bib?  Hmmm.  These are cute, they catch all the "drippings", and they wipe clean with a cloth or while held under running water.
+1	So many bibs are waterproof, but not machine washable. These are!! Not plastic-y feeling, quite comfortable. I've bought others, only to come back to these. Buy em!!
+1	These are the best bibs I've found.  Convenient pouches, machine washable, and cute patterns.  Also, they hold up pretty well.  Recommended.
+1	good for catching finger foods when baby begins feeding himself. although doesn't protect from slimy hands wiped on pants. our son has even experimented with dropping finger foods into the pocket!
+1	Thinner than some of the other bibs out there.  Easy to clean and take on and off.  Perfect simple bib.
+1	What I like:*Dr. Seuss prints are cute and neutral*Vel-cro closure is strong and adjustable for different neck sizes*Good coverage for keeping kid clean*Material easily wipes clean or goes in the washing machine*Material is thick, but not too stiffThis is a high quality set of bibs. The price for the three pack is amazing.
+1	Always looking for a clean bib? Tired of washing them?  BUY THESE! They just need to be wiped off, or at the very most rinsed in the kitchen sink.  You only need three.  As a matter of fact, I only have 2 (one is at my mother in law's house) and it is plenty! These are a great purchase!
+1	I really really like these bibs.  They protect baby's clothes well.  The pouch catches at least some of what gets dropped.  The designs are cute.  They wash off easily.
+1	This bib covers the whole front of the baby's body including his shoulders, upper arms and the whole belly. The pocket does not necessarily stay open to catch all the food, but if you have your baby seated in something with some kind of a tray, you can just lay the bib on the tray and it catches the food pretty well that way. It's made of very durable waterproof fabric, and I like that the white rims are made of the same fabric too. It's super easy to clean. I usually wipe it with a wipe on the go, and then come home and wash it in the sink and hang it dry. I would wash it after a use and it's usually completely dry for the next meal. I have washed them in a washing machine and they came out in perfect shape. They fold up very compactly. I just fold one and roll it up with a spoon and keep it in my diaper bag with his food.
+1	
+1	I was looking for a bib that would cover more of my grandson's shirts and after looking at all the brick and mortar stores I finally looked here and found these.  The reviews from others help make my decision and I am glad I purchased these.  Was a little afraid about spending so much on after all bibs but after using them now for a few months I am glad.  They have with held the washing machine and are easy wiped down and made of softer material so it doesn't bunch up and crinkle.
+1	by far the best bibs we own!  so many great features, nice and big, easy to clean, pouch, soft and pliable!
+1	Love the bibs. They were as bright and vibrant as the picture. I purchased the unisex ones and they were Dr. Suess themed. I love them. They are durable and do not fad in the wash.
+1	I like the Bumkins bibs with the sleeves that tie in the back better, but my hubby prefers to use these. These bibs velcro in the back, and the baby can rip it off pretty easy, which defeats the point. I wish these ones tied, then I'd give it 5 stars.
+1	I was a little skeptical before ordering these cuz I thought they might fade with one or two washes. But it has been 6 months now that I own these and they look still the same. They hold up great in the washer/dryer and make meal times less messy for me. Thanks amazon for the great price!!
+1	Great bibs! Machine washable, waterproof, flexible, not heavy, pocket to catch food is a must have. Unlike most bibs these attach to one side, which makes it a little harder for your little one to pull off.
+1	these bibs are a little big & bulky & a little pricey, but they work great at catching almost all meeses and clean up great.
+1	These are great to toss in the diaper bag. They catch most of the food and liquids, are washable and work great. The velcro closure is pretty strong too.
+1	I like how big these bibs are, covering my entire son's body above high chair tray.  I know he will be able to use them as he grows.  They are very easy to clean in the sink or washing machine.  I like how flexible they are, I can tuck them behind high tray chair if needed, which was what detracted me from the Baby Bjorn ones. They seemed too stiff.
+1	Love these. For some reason, most other bibs I've tried had uncoated fabric edging, which means you can't just wipe food off the trim, however easily it wipes off the main portion of the bib. That means you either send it through the wash (and most of them say not to machine wash them), or slowly build up nasty, unremovable crusties along the trim and piping until the bib is so gross you just throw it out. These are not like that. Food rinses easily off the entire thing, front and back, main part, pocket, and trim. So great! Even if you forget and find the bib a few hours later, it rinses right off with just warm water. They're also soft and flexible enough that my toddler doesn't pull or complain about it until she's done with her meal. First bib I can say that about. I threw all her old bibs away after getting these.
+1	These are great bibs! I saw one review comment that it was "flimsy" and they didn't see how it could ever hold up..... I definitely beg to differ! While these bibs are thin, they are strong! It's annoying for the child to have an overly stiff bib.  These are incredibly thin and flexible, yet the pouch to catch crumbs stays open nicely.  They just flip inside out for easy hand washing or you can throw them in the washer.  Having the entire bib be washable (i.e. no fabric backing) is a huge plus! Our daughter has had the same one for FOUR years now and it still looks and works perfectly.  That's four years of 3 meals, two snacks a day.  It's a hardworking bib.  And, might I add, her only bib because we love it so much! We just rise it with soap and water each night and throw it in the wash every once in a while.  She now also has the toddler version with little cap sleeves (which easily still fits her) for visiting grandparents and using as an art smock there. We got our son one when he was born and we expect it will last just as long! Adorable prints too.  We give these as gifts to new parents and they all have loved them too!
+1	I got these bibs for a 13 month old and love them. They're light, waterproof but soft enough to be comfortable. Pocket works well for melting frozen fruit pucks she loves to eat.  Wash the right after the meal with the dishes and hang them up They're dry before the next meal as claimed.  Prints are really cute and I'll buy more.
+1	These bibs are machine washable/easy to clean and hold up over time. They work for my 9 month old and 3 year old.
+1	We have several brands of bibs and even though they are a bit more expensive these bibs have lasted a year and still look brand new. More importantly they have fit through a year of growing cycles and still cover the majority of spills and drops at every feeding. Great buy!
+1	They're my go-to favorites as far as bibs go.  Easy to clean, don't collect mold like others do.  Great designs.
+1	Very light weight, flexible, VERY EASY to clean and has a large adjustable Velcro strap on the back  for attachment
+1	these are amazing bibs! great size for 6 months. love that they are waterproof. have great coverage and are super cute! favorite bibs!
+1	I love these bibs. They are the best kind I have used so far. They are big and help keep the mess off the little one's clothes. Material is easy to clean and quick drying if you have to rinse it off in the go. I recommend these.
+1	The bibs are very easy to clean and don't stain. The pocket at the bottom saves some food from the floor. We would buy these again!
+1	Although I don't understand why bibs need to be gender-specific, I did purchase these for my daughter. They're lightweight but durable, wash clean easily, and catch the food that dribbles from her chin. Pretty much what you look for in a bib.
+1	I LOVE bumbkins bibs.  They are super easy to clean.  They stay nice.  I can even throw them in the washing machine for a good washing.  I loved having 3 so I really wash down the one she was using and worry about her bib being wet for her next meal.  The elastic did come loose on one but I just stitched it back on.  The other 2 were fine.
+1	Highly recommend these bumpkin bibs. We have these Keith Hardy ones and the Dr Seuss ones, and they are the same except the print. Waterproof material! Easy to rinse clean after feeding or can put in wash and hang dry. Long velcro so can make the neck as small as you need (so for smaller babies it doesn't get shirt wet right around the neck!). We have the cloth ones (so many stains now it's ugly! and stain spraying after is a pain). Someone gave us the hard plastic bjorn ones, and neck doesn't fit right so looks like it could hurt/be annoying to her neck. Also they're so big and bulky that they're harder to store. The bumkins did a good job designing these, and i love them.
+1	These bibs came highly recommended to me and I completely agree! They fold up so small for the diaper bag, they are super easy to wipe off and they do a great job of catching dropped food in the little pouch. Awesome product!
+1	These bibs are awesome. The thin, waterproof fabric cleans up easily and dries quickly. The pouch has saved many outfits... surprisingly can catch and hold a lot of spitups and spills. Definitely much better than the plastic ones.
+1	I had bought one of these bibs previously.  It worked great.  You can wash it out after breakfast and it will be dry for lunch.  Unfortunately, I lost it by transporting it in and out of the diaper bag.  Now, I bought the three pack and couldn't be happier!!  Def recommend!
+1	They're cute, they're durable, they're large enough to actually work. Bumkins does a great job with their bibs, I'd recommend them to anyone.
+1	Add these to your baby registry now!  We have bought 2 of the 3 packs because we love them so much.  We don't really use any other bibs, and have been using them for 2 years now with no complaintsPros:Protect your little ones' clothesEasy to cleanVery cute designsDurableGreat priceCons:None!
+1	These are awesome. Machine washable, the pouches sit out from the bib so they actually catch stuff, and the velcro holds up well. I will never buy a different kind of bib again, and these will become shower presents. As opposed to others, they do not have a backing that comes off in the wash. They are still good as new after lots of washes. I can't say it enough - love these bibs.
+1	I like these bibs; they catch bit of food my daughter dropps before it gets stuck between her and her high-chair.  They wash really well in the washing machine without damage or wear - this was key for me.  (Be sure to stick the velcro pieces together before washing so it doesn't attach to other laundry in the wash.)
-1	I have found these bibs good, but after 4 months of use they began to go moldy in the seams. I always wash or wipe them after use and then hang them to dry so I am surprised that this has happened. They are now too gross to use so back to the search for the perfect bib!
+1	I love these Bumbkins Waterproof Superbib. Not only they come in cute patterns, but they are machine washable. I've been washing them for several months now and the colors are still bright! The bib has a little pocket in the front that collects the food spills. I am purchasing my second set here on Amazon.
+1	fun designs and washes up so easily. I was tired of treating stained bibs and washing them constantly in the washer, these are so easy to clean up. makes dinner and self feeding much easier!
+1	Jul 7 2014: Still great! Look as good as the day I bought them! The velcro can get a little hair and threads in it but it's easy to clean!Feb 22: We still have these awesome bibs! They get washed once every other day and we hang them to dry. They look just as good as new.I was looking for a bib that was machine washable with a pocket and waterproof. I ran across the single Bumkins bibs on amazon.com. After looking some more I noticed these 3 packs which are a much better value!We have been using these bibs around 2 months and they have been amazing! I have washed them many many times and they still look like they did the day we got them. The are super waterproof and protect my daughter's clothing from getting wet or dirty.I usually hang them to dry them but occasionally one will sneak into the dryer and they have come out fine.The patterns on the girl set are so cute!
+1	This is a great bibs for beginning eaters. I like how they are machine washable. Cute designs. Neck size works as well.
+1	These have worked out really well since I started feeding my 7 month old baby food. They have been washed multiple times but still look like new.
+1	Great bib with excellent coverage.  Love the pocket for catching what baby drops.  I hand wash in-between meals and let air dry, but I can also throw them in the washing machine--which I really like.
+1	very easy to clean, dries quickly. the keith haring print looks good on both boys and girls. I'm buying 3 more sets as gifts. I also have a Cutie Pie set, they are also great, only a little smaller.
+1	My son is 7 months old.  We use these everyday.  We haven't moved to solids so I haven't used these for the practical purposes of catching food but these clean very easily which is a huge plus and the velcro has worked after numerous washing.  Plus I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss.  They are super cute and we always get compliments on these bibs.  I've boughten other Bumkin bibs and I am a huge fan now.  Also, they don't fade like some of the other feeding bibs I've used.
+1	I LOVE these bibs!  We've used these and two other types and these are far better.  They're the right balance of water repellent and flexible.  I dont like the cheap plastic Gerber ones because as my daughter moves, they're all over the place.  These stay put like a t-shirt.  Also, they're easily washed.  I threw them in the wash and they even accidentally made it through the dryer too... while I wouldnt recommend drying them, they seemed to survive.Our daughter at 10 months though has figured out how to pull on them to unvelcro them from her neck...so I may end up modifying them to use a snap.  But it doest take quite a bit of effort on her part to get them off.
+1	After my daughter developed an aversion to the Bjorn plastic bib after her soft neck fold got caught in the fastener, I was looking for an easy to clean alternative and found these. They are cute, fold up easily for the diaper bag, and are easy to clean. And my daughter doesn't cry when it approaches her neck like with the Bjorn.
+1	Lightweight and breathable! I even threw them in the washer and dryer and they turned out perfect!  Great for a baby learning to eat  cereal and food!  So much easier than trying to clean by hand and dig out food particles in the seams!!
+1	Great product! very durable, love the patterns and love the pocket! The pocket has caught a lot of dropped food. It's durable in that we wash them in the sink after every meal, our son reaches in (not so gently) to the pocket to retrive dropped food, and he like to remove them himself when he is done with dinner (but pulling them off, opposed to opening the velcro). Speaking of, the velcro is very durable and has yet to tear or become frayed. Great value and worth every dollar.
+1	These bibs are very durable and nicely cover the whole front of our 13 month old daughter.  Also, the "sleek" fabric is easily wipeable (and don't stain), and because the bibs are not hard or plasticky, they lay nicely and don't bunch up in my toddlers face while sitting. Love 'em!
+1	These bibs last forever! I bought some 2 years ago for my now 2 1/2 year old daughter and loved them so much I bought more for my 6 month old. These are so durable and are great at catching spills, drool and food. You can hand wash or throw in the washing machine and they hold up fantastically. We never dried in the dryer, only hang dry. The two I bought a couple of years ago are still in great shape and we used them daily. We now have 5 of these bibs and I can see them lasting a few years! Highly recommend. Cute styles too!
+1	At first I was a little skeptical of these bibs they were so light I didn't know if they were going to be waterproof. However, I was quickly proven wrong. These are tough bibs that are wonderful! We've been using these 3 times a day for the past several months and they haven't shown any signs of wearing.Pros:- Waterproof- Bib covers a lot of area, mine covers my little girls shoulders. Which is awesome for messy days.- Durable construction, the Velcro hasn't shown any signs of wearing- I keep one in my diaper bag, it folds up so easily and small I sometimes forget I have it.- It is great at restaurants, I'm not always worried that she will get food all over her because it is a bigger bib.- Cleans easily; I throw them in the wash and then air dry them.Cons:- NoneI waited to get these because I was on the fence about them. My cousin owned one for her little girl and it was amazing! I had to get these because my previous bibs were not working all that great. I would also purchase these for a new mom's baby shower, these would make an excellent baby gift!
+1	These bibs are very liquid proof and perfect for rice cereal and baby food. The pocket catches most of the drips that the miniature human produces and, unless they tip it up or mess with it, that's where the food stays. The Dr. Seuss theme is very nice.
+1	I love the look of these bibs.  And they are easily wiped clean with a rag.  Also, the style looks great on both a boy and a girl.
+1	Very nice bibs - practical, light, easy to clean, wonderful colors and pattern. Unlike the Baby Bjorn plastic one, which I also like, my son can't open these up and take them off. I have about 20 regular bibs, which I won't use at all, after I got these. Definitely recommend them.
+1	These bibs are waterproof, offer good coverage, have charming patterns, and even a pocket to catch the crumbs. Just right!
+1	These are a great quality toddler bib and we have a lot - everyone should have them in both long and short sleeve!
+1	I'm very happy with these.  A little bright, which is great for my 13-month old.  Waterproof and durable.  We've been using these a few months now, and they've held up very well.  Wipe down very easily with a damp cloth, or just washing it off at the same time as his food plate.  They are machine washable although I haven't found that to be necessary.
+1	Although they seem pricey for a bib, these are an excellent size and material.  They are big enough to cover my one year old's clothes and are easy to take on and off.  They rinse off easily for minor spills and machine wash for bigger ones.  We also use the Bumkins long-sleeved bibs for when we really want to protect an outfit, but these are handy for less messy meals or when we aren't as concerned about keeping the clothes perfect.
+1	These are great the only problem is when the food dribbles down the chin, the ridge of the neck isn't enough to catch it so I still end up with stained shirt collars.  The Tuckaroo bibs are great for this actually, but these bumkins ones are lighter and resist staining better than the Tuckaroos.  I also like these better than the Tommee Tippee Explora Easi-Roll Bibs b/c they are lighter and fit better when in a standard high chair.  The Tommee Tippee w/ the pockets tend to catch on the high chair tray which makes them move around.  Plus the velcro fasters on this are easier to use than the rubber pin fastener on the Tommee Tippee bibs.
+1	The velcro on the side is a great feature. These bibs worked well, we have them a few months later.
+1	We went through several brands of bibs before settling on the Bumkins brand  These are far and away the best. Where we had issues with the others of developing some pretty bad stink, these ones are super easy to wash and clean and take a ton of wear and tear, coming out victorious.  Bib 1 - toddler 0.
+1	Cute, colorful designs. Easy to use and clean: I just wipe it off with a wet paper towel/washcloth or rinse under water. I love how it's waterproof and is big enough to protect my little baby's clothes from spills and stains. Oh, and very convenient to take along in my diaper bag. Love this!
+1	These wash up well and also can be wiped off with a wipe if you are out and about. Also love that when he is teething the slobber does not get through to his clothes. Also nice for feedings since they wash so nicely. I have had these for several months and they are the only bibs that still look like new out of at least 15 different bibs. My son is 9 months old and is very chunky but these bibs fit him perfect and are comfortable on him. The pocket at the bottom is great for catching his food he drops while self feeding.
+1	These bibs are easy to clean, i just wipe them down or throw them in the washing machine, and are made of good material, very happy with my purchase.
+1	The best bibs
+1	I love these bibs. I don't know what they're made of, but as lightweight as they are they provide great coverage and don't feel too bulky (which doesn't cause my little one to grab at them or try to rip them off). The velcro is really good too. He hasn't been able to take one off of himself, yet.
+1	These are BY FAR, my favorite bibs. We have tried many & they always fall apart quickly. These clean up super easy & dry in a matter of minutes. I always have a dry one ready for the next meal! Other brands may be more &#34;durable&#34; fabric, but they are bulky, uncomfortable, & take 24 hrs to fully dry. These are great!
+1	Love them,  wish I found them early, my son is 18 month so he does a mess on meal time, but with this bibs, I dont have to worry about stains on this clotes
+1	When our daughter started eating finger foods, she tended to get messier than she does when we spoon-feed her.  Even with a regular bib, I found myself spending a substantial amount of time treating her clothes for stains.  These bibs are great - waterproof, wide coverage, and a pocket to catch dropped or dribbled bits.  It doesn't hurt that they are cute, too.  I also like the fact that they are machine-washable, but if the mess isn't too big, you can also just wipe them clean.  I am spending a lot less time/money on stain removal on her clothes!  We'll likely buy more, as we have another baby on the way!
+1	These bibs are easy to clean and very durable. Great for messy eaters since they can be wiped off or rinsed off. Only con is the the neck hole is a little big for my 7 month old son, but I doubt that it will be that way for long at the rate he is growing.
+1	I was given a set of bumpkins bibs like this for my son when he was born. Couldn't wait to get this set when I found out I was pregnant with a girl! They've ended up being the only bibs we've ever used! They are durable and can stand the test of time. I use one for every meal. After, I rinse it in the sink then I throw the bib right into the washer and air dry. My son is 20 mo old and we've only ever used the three bumpkins bibs! They still look new! They are a perfectly waterproof without feeling like plastic. I just can't give enough praise for these bibs!
+1	I did not get the exact bibs pictured: please see my uploaded image to see what I got. It was a real surprise because I was expecting a blue, yellow and orange bib. Instead I got a blue, yellow, and green bib and two of the three had different graphics than what was pictured on Amazon. So when you order these, apparently you should expect colors and designs to vary (would've been nice if Amazon said this on the product page when I ordered these).Aside from that, these are good bibs for feeding solids. I bought them because our baby is a messy eater, she'd stain all her cloth bibs and they quickly molded (Gross!). These are very stain resistant, dry super fast and are a generous size. The pocket does catch about 95% of falling food (baby's still on runny baby food). She was very distracted by the bright colors when I first started using these, but I fixed that by putting the bib on her about 15 minutes before the meal. The only down side is that these are not good for bottle feeding because they don't soak up liquid, it just runs all over. So for bottle feeding I use a cloth bib. Overall, I bought these cause they don't stain, they dry quickly on the kitchen counter and make feeding solids easier - I wasn't too concerned about bottle feeding so it's not a big deal. Very happy with them!
+1	I got these after trying out one and falling absolutely in love with it.  First, it is really lightweight and the design is adorable.  Keith Haring being one of my favorite artists with those whimsical designs?  LOVE at first bite:) My little one loves the designs and the fact that it has an easy on easy off velcro is not a problem because when he's done eating, bib comes off quickly.  The pocket is so helpful in catching those little bits that toddlers toss down or drop en route to the mouth.  As well, it wipes clean easily and dries very quickly.  And even despite washing, those fabric bibs will retain some traces of odor or staining from food no matter how many times you wash them.  I love these.  I highly recommend the product for it's design, ease of use, and ease to clean!
+1	these are adorable, gender neutral bibs. i bought cloth bibs before my son started eating bc i was trying to be one step ahead of the game. big mistake. cloth bibs are for drool!! these are for food! they're awesome for traveling too because they dry so quickly! we just took one on our 2 week vacation and it suited us just fine. i won't be buying another kind of bib. BUY THIS
+1	These bibs are great. They make my life so much easier. Once my child uses them, I just put them in hot soapy water then air dry. The velcro hasn't worn away at all. Still sticks great.
+1	I got these bibs a little while ago when I started feeding my son solids.  I really like the bibs, I love the prints, and the pocket, it catches spilled food, however, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the attachment for the neck should be better, allowing for babies with smaller necks to have a nice snug fit.  The bib does indeed allow for adjustment with the bib, but its still a bit too big for my boy.  I do like them though!
+1	Such cute design and it big enough that it covers a good portion of the front area.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't close tight enough around the neck so that sometimes food will get on the collar area.
+1	This bib is perfect. I was skeptical about the pouch initially, but it catches all the food that escapes those tiny fingers. It's also easy to wash. I love the fact that the velcro is in the front as opposed to being in the back. It's those small things that make all the difference, especially when you would prefer having fewer hassles when you are around kids.
-1	I can't speak to the quality of these bibs since I won't be using them, but the drop down box on this order page is useless.  Regardless of which color option you select, you will be mailed the pink, girly bibs shown on the photo.
+1	I LOVE these bibs!  They are absolutely worth the extra money.  They are a cinch to clean, and as a bonus, we always get compliments on how adorable they are.  Highly recommended!
+1	I ordered these for my son based on the reviews, and I have not been disappointed!  I use them day in and day out and I can't say enough good things about them.  They are lightweight and 'breathable' yet totally waterproof.  After every meal, I rinse them or wad them up and squeeze a drop of dish soap on them to wash them out.  Then I wring out the excess water and hang them on a towel rack to dry and voila, they are dry and ready for the next meal!  Periodically I toss them in with a load of laundry for a deep clean. I love how they don't get wrinkled or creased like the plastic bibs- they still look new after 18 months.  The pocket does a great job of catching food.  Seriously such great bibs!  I am ordering more.  (The only thing I'm not in love with is the pattern, Suess is cute and all but these are kind of busy.  That's no biggie at the house but they clash with and overpower his cute outfits when we eat out.  But that's just my silly sense of vanity!)
+1	We have not tried a ton of bibs, but enough to know that I can stop looking.Pros:-SO easy to clean (just run them under the faucet, use a soapy sponge if necessary, shake and hang up)-SUPER fast drying - I hang by the cabinet knob over the dish drainer, but have also used a towel to dry them off with success-Effective - have not had any messy baby food leak through these-Decent fit - I have a skinny 7 month old - these are still a touch big around the neck even with the velcro tight, but I expected this. We have had FAR fewer issues with food getting on her collar with these bibs (still happens sometimes but these are the best so far).-Design - the pocket is easy to invert and clean. I like that the velcro is on the side, makes it easier to take off one handed while also cleaning baby off.I bought a three pack but have been using the same one for two weeks and it still looks brand new. I can't think of any cons...
+1	Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.
+1	These are my go-to bibs. They wipe clean simply and love the pocket to catch food. My little one seems to think it is the best for storing snacks for later. :)
+1	I love how easy these are to clean. The design has not faded and I love the pocket design. My twins are a little messy and these bibs protect their clothes.
+1	These are great. Not super-thick plastic, but light weight and cute. Easy to travel with, and use at home. We've been using them for over a year and they still look great. Easy to launder. Would definitely buy again.
+1	We tried at least 7 different bibs before these and these are #1. They are large, waterproof, and have a big crumb catcher pocket. They are also very flexible instead of some of the others we tried that were very rigid.
+1	These bibs are an absolute must have.  If your baby is anything like ours, most of the food will most likely end up on these bibs when they first start on solids.Here's what we love about these bibs:-  Easy to clean (use a wet paper towel to wipe clean)-  Also machine washable-  Fabric is soft yet waterproof, and also very durable-  The bibs are adjustable (there's about a 2 inch long strip of velcro instead of the one size fits all bibs, allows you to keep the bib as tight or loose as you like-  The colorful designs are easily recognizable, so my son knows that when we put these bibs on, it's time to eat
+1	These are the best bibs, they are reusable, easy to wipe down, and easy to put in the diaper bag for eating out.  I bought more just so I could leave some in the diaper bag and one over at Grandma's.
+1	I have a bunch of these for my daughter. They are easy to clean and get on and off my daughter. The little pocket helps with messes and my daughter sometimes eats what she drops!
+1	good bibs for feeding baby food, as they catch what runs down the bib in the little pocket. NOT so good for using during bottle feeding. These bibs are a lot thinner material than I expected and the formula just soaks right thru.
+1	We love these bibs. We used iplay bibs for drooling and spit up (which are also awesome), however, they weren't cutting it for baby food. These are soft, rinse or wipe right off, and dry quickly. I thrown them in the wash once a week for good measure and they are fine there too. Even forgot and put them in the dryer and they were still fine. And how cute are the pattern choices?! Love.
+1	I love the Dr. Seuss designs and the waterproof quality.  I searched for bibs like this, and was very happy with this purchase.  They are lightweight which makes them easy to wash and dry.  Super durable and waterproof, great for feeding time!
+1	We love these bibs!!!  They cover our baby's (7 months old) entire shirt and the velcro is adjustable so we can tuck it in under his chin as well.  They're super easy to take on and off, we rinse off in the sink and hang to dry and throw in the washing machine after a couple uses.  They are good quality and will last!
+1	Good product. Our old ones were Bumkins, too, so this was an easy choice. We had to replace the bibs after the 1st child, since moldy looking spots formed at the back after 3 years of non use. Its cheap enough, so that's not a problem. Cute designs for baby girls.
+1	Everything you need-water resistant, wipeable, pocket to catch dropped food, the bib is large and the Velcro neck is adjustable from small to large. I was so tired of going through 10 bibs a day and then disappointed when he outgrew some of them. I travel with these and will buy them again
+1	These are by far the best bibs I have bought. I love the bumkins bibs. They wash up nice and hold up great. The only negative is if your child pulls at their bibs, they might be able to pull off this kind of bib since it is attached by velcro.
+1	I originally bought the Bjorne plastic bibs, but found then too hard. Love that the Bumpkin bibs move like cotton bibs but are wipeable. I also own the sleeved version, which may be more useful when my LO feeds himself, but are kind of a hassle to put on. These are perfect for when I am feeding him, and the set of three is the perfect amount!
+1	I love the Seuss motif, but more than that, the quality of the bib is great.  Resists stains, can be rinsed in between a few feedings (if they're not horrendously messy!) and washes nicely in the machine.  I hang dry mine to ensure they last longer, and they dry very quickly, but I'm sure you can still throw them in the dryer.  The Velcro seems sturdy and doesn't get all mangled and destroyed in the wash like some do.  My son likes to pull his bibs off, so we thought we had to stick with the fabric snap-on ones, but for some reason, he can't easily pull these off.  Nice!
+1	Waterproof, and large to cover most of my son's clothing.  Pocket catches some of the crumbs and chunks, but not all.  We LOVE these.
+1	Been using these a year with no complaints.  Velcro is still good, catching food that falls, washes well.  The only thing more I could ask for is sleeves for the messy days.
+1	First these are adorable.  Second they are extremely lightweight which is perfect in the summer. They have a side Velcro latch, not like the kind that Velcro in the back of the neck and irritate the skin. Most important, they are easily wiped clean after a messy eater.  Love them!
+1	I don't give 5* 'cause when my 17 mo eats his breakfast (oatmeal that I prepare with soy milk) he spills it  and  goes to the bib's pocket (as expected) then the pocket sticks to the bib (oatmeal is very sticky) so the rest of the oats spills outside and makes a mess on his pajamas. Other kind of food is not a problem: fruits, meats, vegetables. I wash them by hand easily and let them dry hanging. I been using them for 2 months and they look like new still!I definitely recommend it!
+1	We love these bibs, not only because of their graphic and interesting designs, but because they are easy to use and clean! We usually rinse them well and hang them to dry, and then throw them in the laundry once a week. We bought another three pack after we fell in love with the first pack. And we get people who stop us because they think it's so cool that we have Keith Haring bibs for our baby.
-1	The bib is fine until your baby insists on feeding him/herself or spits food back out. Then it slides all the way down past the pocket and onto his/her diaper bulge and lap or pants or the highchair seat because the pocket doesn't stay open. The pocket only catches about 10% of whatever falls its way which still leaves me with a baby who needs a complete bath after EVERY meal, and a full change of clothes because the food has soaked through the pants and the bottom of her onesie down to her diaper!
+1	Easy to clean, velcro stays secure, and big enough to cover my 8 month old.  What's better is you can wipe them with a clean cloth OR wash them in the washer and dry them in the dryer or hang dry.  Either way - they are durable!
-1	We used these bibs for about 1 1/2 yrs, and for a while I thought they were pretty great. But over time, they started to get a little.... gross...  We'd always have them hanging over the water faucet spout to dry out (which is kindof a pain b/c they're always in the way) but even doing that they still got mildew spots on them!Overall here's my analysis of using these bibs long-term:POSITIVE: They do have a pouch to catch food, and it is even water-proof!NEGATIVE: The pouch is not self-supported to stay propped out, so the food may just slide by if the pouch isn't magically held out at all timesPOSITIVE: You can wash them w/ your other laundryNEGATIVE: I'd always forget to grab them when I was doing the right loadPOSITIVE: They are better than most bibs out thereNEGATIVE: After continued use, even if you regularly wash and air them out, they will smell STINKY!! And they'll have mildew spots on them.My recommendation: Buy Baby Bjorn!!!!!!!!!!!!!BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Soft Bib - YellowHere's why:Unlike Bumkins, Baby Bjorn will NOT STINK over time, will NOT MILDEW, and is even EASIER to keep clean! A simple rinse in the sink is usually fine, but you can also throw them in the dish washer- you can't get much easier than that. Oh, and the Baby Bjorn's pocket is self supported, so it's always propped out to catch the food! Coming from a mom of a messy toddler, that makes a big difference!Now ditch the Bumpkins and buy a Baby Bjorn, ya hear???!
+1	I never thought I would see the day that I would be reviewing bibs. I had no idea how important bibs would be in my life before my son was born! He started solid foods a couple months ago, and anyone knows what a mess that is! I bought some other bibs for feeding time, but they were sort of like a vinyl tablecloth material with fabric around the neck, and very hard to clean. I am a bit of a germophobe, and I never felt they got clean.  I was on the lookout for something waterproof and easy to clean. These are exactly what I was looking for!I got them about a week ago, and I LOVE them. I bought the boy assortment, and though not exactly as pictured, they are very cute. One has blue with circles, one is green with airplanes and trains, etc., and the other has brightly colored cats and dogs. I love all the designs. I can't say enough about the quality of these bibs. Nothing so far has stained them, and they are super easy to clean. You can throw them in the washer, but I just use a little dish soap and hand wash them and hang them to dry.  They dry REALLY fast. Since I have 3, I can use a different one at each feeding, but even if I only had one it would be dry by the next feeding. I like that the velcro strip is long, so they will grow with my son. I can adjust these to be small enough so the food doesn't get under his chin and through the neck opening and onto his clothing, which happens with a lot of bibs because of the neck hole being large.I also looked at the Baby Bjorn soft bib. I couldn't decide which, so I asked my husband's opinion and he thought the Baby Bjorn looked weird, so I decided on these.I am SO glad I bought these.  They are definitely worth the price. I would recommend these to anyone! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them.
+1	Love these bibs!  They hold up really well, can be put on the top rack of your dishwasher for cleaning and aren't super stiff like a lot of the other bibs out there.  Best bib out there!
+1	What was I thinking using cloth bibs when I first starting giving solids to my baby?  These r the way to go. U just wipe it off after use. And it has a little catch pouch which helps too.
+1	I love these bibs.  They fit well, even on my 3 year old.  They are flexible enough to be stuffed between my 9 month old and her tray.  Best of all, I just through them into the wash when they get dirty.  yay!
+1	I absolutely love the bumkins brand bibs and have found them to be a must have for my kids.  They are nice and light but waterproof and wash up in no time! The pockets are great to catch anything the kids may drop, I hang them on the bottle rack by the pocket to dry so that it stays open better when they are wearing it and that seems to work great!I will say that the neck opening is fairly large and some babies are able to easily pull the bib off.  My niece is 7 months and is a pro at ripping it off but my 2 (1 and 2yrs) have never messed with it.They hold up great some of mine are almost 2 yrs old and look as good as my new Dr. Suess ones! I will continue to purchase these bibs as long as I (or friends/family) have kiddos who need them!
+1	We love those bibs, use them daily, saves a lot of laundry/ stain treatments. We have two per kid so that we can clean it and hang it dry (dries fast) but still have one in reserve if it gets too messy and not dry in time ... also they are perfectly wipeable. The pack easily and fold together small so you can stack on in the diaper bag.I used to have to buy them individually at BabiesRus, the price here on amazon is so much better, you basically get one free. I have given them as gifts and everybody loves them. Was sad to see on the newest ones I ordered though that they are not made in the US anymore ...
+1	i used similar-looking bibs that i'd gotten from babiesrus, but when i tried to rinse them with soapy water, the plastic separated from the fabric over time. These bibs are washable, waterproof (like cup-upside-down-on-bib-but-clothes-are-dry waterproof) and i love that they velcro on the side.
+1	These toys are adorable and functional. They'll attach to other toys, including playmats, stroller toys etc. Not so sure why they're so expensive though.... still fun and unique!
-1	He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great. So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us.
+1	This toy is a little bigger than I thought it looked which is a good thing as I was worried the balls would be small and a choking hazard. They are large enough that's not an issue.
+1	I was hesitant to buy this due to the price, but loved how they looked so thought I would take a chance - glad I decided to buy. My son (now 5 months old) loves the funky creatures (we unlinked the stuffed toys for him to play with when he was younger) and enjoys chewing on the colorful links. These are some of the best links I've found and we use them all of the time to link things together or to link toys to his stroller/car seat.
+1	My 5 1/2 month old loves this new toy. Oslo, the dog is her new favorite chew thing. She likes pulling apart the panels of the box. She likes chewing the flaps and looking in the mirror. I can fit in a few more of her favorite soft rattles and pack the box in her diaper bag for trips out. She can be entertained indefinitely with this.
-1	I thought these sounded like a good a good idea but it turned out to be completely weird.  You put food in the little net and then the baby is supposed to chew on it and suck the food out.  However my kids all found it strange to have the net in their mouth and nothing we put in these made the kids want to use them.  We threw them away shortly after purchasing them.
+1	My daughter really liked to use this product. She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more. I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it.
+1	love these little guys, but just note, that for bananas...they will need to be cleaned right away and the brown crust never really comes all the way out! But other than that, they are great for all types of fruit and keeping your little one as clean as possible! Which we all know means some mess!
+1	My little one just did not get interested in this product. Having said that I have known many other babies they love them. I think it just depends on the baby. The product washed well and worked as intended. However I did not wash it several times since we did not use it a lot. I am still giving one as a baby gift along with other first feeding items though so I recommend giving it a try.
+1	Best thing we have found to put in them is watermelon. It doesn't make the mesh all nasty like bananas and strawberries do.
-1	My son didn't like this very much.  It seemed very cumbersome to put a piece of fruit into the net.  Often times the fruit would be too small and it moves around in the net too much and hard for the baby to eat it or the fruit would be too large and it won't fit into the net.  I almost have to cut it up perfectly so it's snug and baby can get to it easier.
+1	This was great for when my son couldn't have solids yet.  He LOVED being able to taste the yummy fruits that we'd put in these!!
+1	So worth the price. I put mashed bananas or frozen baby food in them and let her chew away. It really helps with teething!
+1	My daughter is 4 1/2 months old and LOVES fruit... I let her suck on it but it always made me nervous... well, a teething baby + frozen fruit = happy girl! She absolutely loves these things and sucks the juice out of any fruit I put in it, plus the frozen fruit gives her poor gums some relief. I highly recommend these, just break out the bib because your little one will be drooling all over the place :)
+1	I absolutely love these fresh food feeders. They can be used when baby is still too small for food but may have started teething. You can put an ice cube or a frozen cube of breast milk or formula inside of them and let a teething baby chew on it. And it's great for fruits, veggies, pretty much any food that you can fit inside of it! We continued to use one with my son after he had gotten a few teeth and it didn't tear or wear out. They can be a little messy, but then feeding a baby anything gets messy, no matter what you do. I always recommend these to friends and I'm on my second set with my second baby.
+1	Helpful for kids to try new foods that might otherwise present a choking hazard.  Also helpful with teething - just pop in some cold fruit and baby will certainly enjoy.
-1	we got this as an introduction to fruits for our 18 month old but he doesen't like it hes weird out about it and rather eat the fruits alone then use this ....it was pointless to buy it because hes never wanted to use it totally afraid of it.
-1	My husband and I both tried and tried - it was impossible.  Now it's become a chew toy without anything inside to chew.  Oh well.
+1	Great idea, but my son hated it!  He didn't like the mesh texture over his banana.  He simply just wanted to eat the banana.  LOL  This concept is great, but if you have a picky eater than this will not work.  Go ahead and try this product because your baby might like it!  My rating is based on the concept not usage.
+1	I bought these with high hopes of using them with my son. I honestly never remembered I had them on the shelf and hardly used them. My friends love them and got a lot of use out of them.
+1	These things are wonderful! My son was an early teether-only nine weeks and he started drooling like a fiend-so once we started him on cereal a month later and the drooling became pain in his gums, we stuffed every kind of frozen fruit into these things, my husband even did ice cubes, and he just went to town on them. We're having our second son in another month and we are buying new ones from Toys R Us, they have a two pack with caps that are really cheap.If paint chipped or pieces of plastic or mesh came loose, I never saw it and as for being difficult to clean, well, duh. You turn the mesh inside out when theyre done eating from it, rinse well and chuck the whole thing into the dishwasher. As long as you dont let it sit so the mushy fruit dries inside, it comes out easy enough for the dishwasher to handle the rest.Someone also said that most of the food stays inside-well, thats the whole point. Whole foods are choking hazards for little guys/girls, remember? This gives them all the juice and vitamins without the hazard.Messy? Again, duh. But slap a bib on the kid-a water proof one-or let him go in a diaper if its warm enough-and let them go to town. Whats a drippy mess compared to twenty minutes or more of pain relief combined with a nice vitamin boost? For me, that was worth every ounce of mess.For the record, to this day my son, now nearly three, still eats bowls full of frozen fruit the same way most kids eat ice pops so thats another benefit I feel it gave him.
+1	These are fun and fabulous!When you start introducing solids, you can put chunks of juicy food in these bags and let your baby go to town. Watermelon is the best! And they're safe - you, as the parent, get to relax for a moment or two while your baby gets to go to town on something tasty and new! The closure is very strong - our kid never got them open by herself.Teething or a super-hot day? I put ice in it. (supervision is required for all baby feeding!)Peaches, bananas, plums, melons, anything squishy and juicy! Keep the camera ready too!
+1	I really like these mesh feeders.  The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.  The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.  The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.
+1	My grandson is just starting to teeth and I wanted something that would prevent him from chockinglove these! I have purchased 6 of them and additional replacement screens
+1	Once my son started on solids we were excited to bust these out.  We put fresh fruits in them especially in these summer months.  Also since my son is teething we pop in a few ice cubes and instant teether.  They are easy for him to hold on to as well.
+1	My little one loves eating ice and ice pops out of these things and they are great. Haven't tried fruit/veggies yet but it hasn't disappointed me.
+1	I freeze breastmilk in small ice cubes (don't fill all the way to the top) then pop an ice cube in them for my teething baby. He loves them. They work great and he hasn't been able to get them open... actually I don't think my 2.5 yr old has gotten them open either and he gets everything open. I've heard certain foods are really icky eaten out of these and hard to clean, but I'm doing baby led weaning so I won't use them for food.
+1	Hard to clean but great for starting little ones out on fresh fruits that they cannot chew yet. Our little guy enjoyed strawberries in these
-1	I let my child try and eat some mashed up banana with this, and three it in the sink. When I did the dishes it was a brown crusty mess and I just tossed it. The whole experience was a big mess. There are better ways
+1	I started using this with my infant when he was 4 months old. He loves sucking on ice cubes. Now that he's older, he's getting a good taste of fruits with this item. I attach it to a pacifier holder so it doesn't drop on the floor.
+1	I haven't tried food in these, but they do work GREAT for teething babies.  Just put some ice cubes inside.  They just suck on the cold water.  It is perfect and a LIFESAVER.  I would buy this product just for that!  I do give it four stars because this product is meant for more than just ice....and I don't know how it will work with food.
+1	I have hand scrubbed, machine sanitized and stood over the sink picking tiny pieces of week old banana out of the folds of mesh on this thing. Still not really clean. I could give it to the baby. But in the back of my mind, I'd wonder if some food borne bacteria has made it's way into my little man's food. Not worth it.UPDATE: We had a friend tell us to try this feeder for strawberries or apples. We were reluctant at first, but it's actually not too hard to clean for these items. I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 4 with the caveat - using it with bananas ruined it. But it's been a big hit for our little guy, who seriously loves his apples.
-1	I've tried offering this to my baby several times beginning at 6 months.  She is now 9.5 months and still won't use it.  I put banana in it, her favorite food and try to show her how to use it to eat it.  But she is just not interested.  She didn't even really want to play with it as a toy.  Also the price they are charging here is too high.  I found it for several dollars less at Target.
+1	I had these with my 6 year old and I loved them.  I bought a different brand with the second kid and that brand sucked.  I had to get another one of these.  These are easy to clean, easy to open, they stay shut when you want them to, and they do the job.  I love using them to give the baby fruit or to put frozen fruit which helps with teething.
+1	My 4 month old loves gnawing on cold apple slices in this feeder to relieve her teething pains.  Other mommy friends of mine use these for milk popsicles too!
+1	Havent used these yet, but got them from a friend. I know they will come in handy when she starts eating more fruits/veggies, etc.Friend mentioned to me that they are great for &#34;boo boo's&#34;- put an ice cube in them and give to little kids.
-1	Yes, I read all the reviews saying that these are impossible to clean.  I thought: oh I'm not some OCD clean freak; plus I'll clean it right after use, unlike all those OTHER people.  Silly me!  Everyone was right.  You know how they sell those bottle brushes, complete with nipple brush?  That's because we don't want bacteria in our babies' foods, right?  Since they don't sell a brush in the world that could clean this thing, there is really no way to get it clean.  And I don't want my sweet boy ingesting some banana from last week.  It was fun for a one-off experiment! But we like to be more sustainable than one-off excursions into plastic.  Oops.  Humble pie is mine.
+1	great with bananas. haven't tried it with apples or pears yet. But granddaughter loves it. It is convenient for the mother as well and you can take it anywhere with you
+1	I liked this product although I did find it somewhat of a pain to clean after putting someting like avocado or banana in it.
+1	Such a clever little thing to have for those little teethers! They are a bit hard to clean but I guess that's because the mesh is so fine to avoid chunks breaking through!
+1	Great for most fruits and even cooked veggies, we used bananas one time and my son loved it but it took abut 10 minutes to get it fully cleaned
+1	Baby and I both just love the Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder.  I stuff a banana in there and he goes to town.  The rings make the feeder very easy for him to hold.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had a lot of trouble cleaning the banana out of the mesh.  I just make sure that the banana is very ripe.  The only downside to this product is that it makes a huge mess, but he loves it so much that I don't mind!
-1	These are impossible to clean.  I gave them to my baby with banana and after soaking it for days and multiple wash attempts, there is still food in it.  Its a great product in theory, but the mesh just doesn't work.  We ended up throwing the one away and just using the other one for ice chips for sore gums.
+1	We've had these for both our kids (one 7 months and one 2 1/2) and we love them.  Early on they are great for putting diced apples or other juicy fruit in and letting a teething baby chomp away.  We use them with just ice cubes in them for teething also and when our toddler bites her tongue or lip or anything like that.  I haven't found them difficult to clean at all as long as you empty and rinse them promptly.
-1	This is by far the worst feeder bag on the market.  It is impossible to clean, unlike the brands where the bag can be removed.  Try the Kid Co. Baby Steps.  The bags can be removed for thorough cleaning which means you can buy new ones if they start to look worn.  Feeders are a great idea to introduce new flavors to babies without the risk of choking.  You can also make cold "teethers" with frozen breastmilk.  Highly recomended, just not this brand.
+1	These little things are built well and are easy to use. The only thing is the mesh. It seems a little heavy but it is durable and doesn't seem like it can be broken very easy. You can put any type of little snack you want in these (frozen milk, frozen water, frozen baby food, frozen fruit, or non frozen things....). Great little product.
+1	Great idea for a teething baby. easy to put chunks of frozen fruit or ice into. takes some time to disinfect due to mesh bag but over all i would recommend to others.
-1	The base of the handle is very chunky, making it hard for little hands to wrap around.  It also is VERY heavy for little hands to hold onto.  If you want to use a mesh feeder, you will end up being the one holding onto it if you choose this one.  I like the quality of the mesh part, however.
+1	I love these feeders for bananas!  Are they messy and a pain to clean...Yes!!  But, it can occupy your child as he/she feeds herself.  My favorite use of this is when we are flying with our daughter.  It keeps her hands and mouth busy during take off.  To clean the mesh, just let it soak for a bit and then use your fingers to get the food out of the crevices.  It takes a little time, but I definitely think this has been a great product to use with my daughter.
+1	My baby is 7 months old.  We've been using these for a couple months now and they are great at pacifying him!  All of the teething rings that we keep in the freezer make his little hands so cold, so these are a great alternative for a baby who is teething.  We bought a big bag of frozen fruit to use in these and have found that he likes the peaches the best.  We tried fresh fruit (strawberries & bananas), but those not only created a huge mess on him, but it was extremely difficult to clean the bananas out of the feeder.  I literally had to scrape the little pieces off with my fingernail AFTER running it through the dishwasher and then trying to wash it by hand with a bottle brush.  So we're sticking with the frozen peaches.  I'm actually on here to buy a second pack of 2 today so that we always have a clean one available.
+1	I just ordered 2 more of these for my 8 month old.  I use them all the time.  I keep one in the diaper bag to use at restaurants and many more places.  She loves using them.  She gets excited every time she sees these.  I put fruit and vegetables in them and they are a big hit.  I would definitely recommend these to others.
+1	Just received these in the mail-- I also ordered the NUK version for comparison.However I was concerned after I ordered this item about a reviewer stating that these were NOT BPA free.  This is incorrect.Says right on the package that these are BPA free (of course there is no picture of the package for this item only the feeders themselves).  I also checked the product description and it says nothing about BPA.I've been vigilent about making sure that everything that goes into my baby's mouth is BPA free so I will admit I was relieved that I dind't have to return them or throw them out and was kicking myself for not checking more carefully before clicking "buy" on my Amazon iPhone app.So I'm not sure if it's an issue with older version of this product, but it seems to me that any baby brand worth their salt these days are eliminating BPA from their baby products. And Munchkin seems to be a very responsible brand.So don't be alarmed and rest assured that the package for the Munchkin Fresh Food feeders says BPA FREE.
-1	Tried these a few years back and hated them. I thought they were a pain, hard to clean, and just overall a bad idea. With twins, its much easier to just cut fruits up in small bite size pieces and let them use their hand and eye coordination to try picking them up off high chair tray.
+1	A pain to wash clean but it works great. Baby is entertained with a banana and recently Orange in there for some time. :)if you freeze a banana first it helps with teething
+1	I only use these to put ice chips in when my little guy's teeth are hurting him. He loves it. I literally get screamed at when I take it away to refill(he's only 7 months, so I will let him slide on that). I tried teething rings and other teething toys, they helped but not half as well as these.
+1	I do not know if it is easy to use, this is to help my sister to buy a child, he had not been born, so not useful.
-1	Haven't been able to get my 8 month old to use these. Have been trying for a few months. Love the idea, but she won't touch them. I tried them too, and can't blame her. The taste and feel of the mesh is not very pleasant.
+1	We have 3 total and might use a few more. Baby loves it! We've given him grapes, oranges, bananas, and clementines. He gets sooo upset when we take it for a refill. The handle is great too since he can hold it himself.
+1	Can't beat amazon price. One can find these great item at the store, but can beat amazon even with shipping fees. Great for my grandson it helps with teething and the right amount comes out for his little mouth at the time
+1	My 7-mo old son loooves this thing. When he's fussing, this always quiets him.  Just a slice of apple in there, and he's occupied for a good 20 minutes! Also very easy to wash, and fits nicely in a diaper bag.
+1	My son absolutely loved using the feeder. But its a pain cleaning it after putting bananas or something mushy in it. The handle also doubles as a teether. Worth buying!
+1	I like the Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder. It allows you to put fresh foods like frozen fruits and whole fresh fruits of apples,bananas,peaches,grapes,blueberries etc. Without the worries of him choking on a piece of fruit. I even tried small animal crackers but I prefer not to try it in the feeder again due to its nutritional value. Anyway, It is small enough to travel with and I like the big ring for little fingers to grasp and I can link it to his stroller or car seat while he snack without it falling on the floor. It is easy to wash. some have mentioned in their reviews about the difficulty to clean up bananas-I just keep some bananas puree frozen, put it in the feeder and then give it to my son to suck on. When my son lose interest, it is not too bad of a mush inside the feeder and then I just soak it in a bowl of water to clean. With other foods I just rinse and lay it in his dish rack to dry! bottom line: it is safe,easy and portable to use. I would buy it again with my next baby.
-1	I knew several people that used these and loved them, but they were more of a hassle for me. I put in a few different foods to try and all of it ended up being mush in a sack.My daughter would try it, lick it then toss it on the floor where it would squish all over the place. And don't get me started with cleaning this nasty thing. GROSS!In theory the feeder sounds great but functionally its gross and traps food in places. blah! :(
-1	The Sassy is better on both counts.  It holds more food and the mesh is removable for easier cleaning and replacement.
+1	Not only are these perfect for introducing fruits and berries but we also use it as a teether too! I just stick an ice cube in the little net and my little one loves how it feels on his little gums!
-1	Cleaning this thing is just impossible! Seriously, you have this plastic ring and the food goes between the mesh and the ring. No amount of rinsing will get rid of it, you have to hand pick all the tiny particles of the fruit. Takes forever and who has time or energy to do it with a little one at home.
+1	My baby loves Sophie, but when sophie's not doing the trick this helps. I put frozen fruits inside and he loves it. It gets pretty messy but I expect it being he's feeding himself. I would reccomend cleaning right after it's used.
-1	My son did not like these also the netting came apart. They are also hard to open.
+1	A great way to freeze fruit and introduce safely to baby.  Need to get a few more of these and give to friends as gifts.
+1	I have one of these for my 6 month old granddaughter.  I pop a chunk of apple or banana etc. in and she goes to town.  It is so easy to clean.  Even with banana.  I take it to the sink right away and rinse it off under a strong stream of cold water, turn the bag inside out (so easy!) and do the same and then finish it off with a rinse in very hot water. Sometimes I swish it around in sudsy water and rinse it good, but we have very hot water so I don't worry about germs that much.  It comes out looking like new.  I let it dry on the counter on a clean towel.  This little gadget will keep my granddaughter happy for quite a while, but as soon as she's not interested anymore I take it to the sink and clean it, never had any problems getting it clean and sometimes it is quite a mess.  It closes so securely I never worry about her being able to open it and the handle is so nice she can easily hold it herself.  She gets excited when she sees me getting this ready.
+1	LOVE THESE!  If you clean them as soon as your baby is done eating, they are truly a must-have!  I like to freeze yogurt in ice cube trays, along with endless amounts of other mushy foods.  It's great entertainment for the babies, and gives Mom or Dad some time to clean the kitchen, cook a meal, eat a warm meal (yes, I said it!).  Great buy!
+1	We used these with our second child so that she can eat what everyone else is having for dinner and I don't need to make baby food.  It makes it so easy to give her a variety of food choices.  They can be hard to clean if you don't clean them right after dinner- I flip the mesh inside out and run it under water and scrub it with my fingers before putting it in the dishwasher and I don't have any issues with it coming out clean.  If you have a teething baby- you can put ice cubes inside and they are great on sore gums.  We also keep one in the fridge with frozen fruit in it most of the time to just pull out whenever the baby needs/wants something to chew on.
+1	Amazing product, my LO loves it for teething.  We freeze breastmilk or food and give it to him and he loves it.  It's like a ice cream for him
+1	minha filha come frutas com ele desde os 4 meses e adora e nao se afoga. facil de limpar e bem bonito
+1	This is one of the best baby gadgets I have ever seen. Give it to the baby with a piece of fruit or cookie inside, and you can have a peaceful dinner or conversation. The only problem is that the baby will end up in a mess (especially with fruit) no matter how many bibs you use, but it is a small price to pay for the convenience and security! We also use it with ice to sooth her teething gums. I highly recommend it, plus everyone who has seen it at work loves it!
+1	We used this with apples, carrots, celery, radish, and other hard fruits and vegetables, and it worked great. We never saw the need to use one of these for something like banana or avocado, because we just mashed those up and gave them to the baby. It's great for teething, and also great for giving babies the opportunity to try tastes and textures that would otherwise be really challenging - like celery.We used these with two kids, often, and never saw any blue fibers in the food.
-1	My son loved these but they were ruined after one cleaning in the dishwasher, kroger brand is much better.
+1	These are great for teething babies, especially if you put fruit in them and pop them in the freezer for a few hours. A few reviewers have complained that they are hard to clean. The only thing I had a hard time cleaning out of them was banana. Generally, I turned the little "bag" part inside out and put them in the top rack of my dishwasher. If you clean them out right away, you have less of a problem. They are also good for just holding a plain old ice cube when baby is teething. These are a great shower gift.
+1	We have been using these for a few months and they are on our must have baby gift giving list.  They are easy to use, almost always easy to clean (except bananas) and a great way to introduce foods.  Love this product.
+1	AWESOME MUST HAVE!!!!! ok i got these at first b/c my LO started teething around 3 months and she liked frozen breastmilk cubes to realieve the pain, which was super messy--this contained the cubes perfectly and she was able to hold it herselfNow that she is older we are now using it to contain her food so she doesn't get it everywhere These are totally a must have product that I never would have thought of and these are definately going to be on my list of things to gift people for baby showersthe only problem i see with it is cleaning the mesh--a toothbrush helps to get all the junk out but it is a little time consuming to do so--that being said there is too much good about the product for that to be a really big negative (and i would not want the mesh any bigger b/c it would make the food chunks to big for younger babes)awesome awesome awesome (even my grandmother was impressed , she wishes they had these when she had her kids)
-1	Great concept, but I do not like these. They are hard to open (which I realize is good for the child, but I still don't like it) as well as near impossible to really clean.
+1	It was love at first sight between my grandson and his munchkin feeder--and if you factor me in, it's a love triangle. I bought this before he was even born because, the minute I saw it, I thought it was brilliant. Even before the baby was introduced to solids, I was using it to hold a chilled, chamomile-tea soaked little sock to ease his teething discomfort. When it would get warm, I'd just dip the whole thing in more chilled tea.Sure enough, when solids were allowed, I found it to be a safe, sanitary, and fun way to introduce new foods and textures to a baby. It gives the baby a sense of control and allows him to pace himself instead of having a someone else spoon-feeding him at regular intervals. By the second use, he already recognized it and reached out for it with excitement.While you can't rely on munchkins to provide the balanced nutrition provided during baby's meals, a daily session with a snack food (frozen or cold bananas and poached apples and pears (sometimes sprinkled with crushed graham crackers) are great favorites with my grandson and provide me with a few extra minutes to prepare dinner without interruption as he sits happily in his high chair. It also has provided me with funny photographs and great movie footage!I see that the photo now being shown on amazon shows a different opening mechanism than on the unit I bought so many months ago. It HAS to be an improvement over mine which requires small fingers but with a powerful grip, short fingernails, and a sturdy butter knife to pry open. I just may splurge and get these new improved models.
-1	These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution. I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces. Bad idea. These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere. I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits. And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary. Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby? God no. Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams.
+1	My son could not get enough of these.  We would put a piece of melon in them and put them in the freezer, he would get so happy and excited as soon as he saw the colors and knew he was getting some relief and some sweet melon.  We tried grapes, bananas, carrots, and several other things.  The veggies did not go over so well, the bananas were kind of hard to clean but most of the other fruits were great.
-1	I have three of the Munchkin Fresh Food FeedersMunchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Varythat I purchased to use when our first baby started asking to eat solids (there were no silicone versions at the time). They worked beautifully, but were a bear to get clean. The fabric mesh holds food particulate in the seams that was nigh impossible to remove completely.Enter the Clevafeed.Clevamama ClevafeedI love the silicone bag of the Clevafeed! This eliminates the food-buildup issue of the older style and is so easy to clean and sanitize. The silicone bag is also completely removable so that every little nook can be completely cleaned. Awesome! The original concept that allows and encourages babies to start trying solid foods in an improved and easy to clean design. I will buy more of these!Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!
+1	Obviously, I bought late, yet this is more suitable for teething baby, my daughter a lot of long teeth, do not need this, but this is not bad
+1	These are adorable but were a little smaller then I expected them to be.  EIther way, my son loves them and has enjoyed them in the tub!
-1	I am not very happy with these toy. Given that they are fun and colorful, I am reluctant to give these to my 5 month son. At this age he pulls everything into his mouth--chewing on green turtle's head is favorite. However, the toys have very strong plastic smell which did not go away after almost a month out of the bag. The packaging has no mention of BPA free plastic. Paint on these toys is a think layer on top of one color plastic toy. It was a bit sticky when I first received these toys, which made me think that it is not very safe for a baby to lick or chew. Considering the smell and paint, these toys are underused. I wish I did not purchase this set.
+1	I purchased these for my 11 months old grand daughter to use in our water table outside, pool and bath. She loved them. They are so colorful and she loved squesing the water out at her cousins. Her older cousins ages 7 to 15 had just as much fun with them as her. They all float and seem to call for you to play with them. They also have a tecture that seemed to please my grand baby as well. I would recommend this to my friends.
+1	The bath toys are colorful, quality, playful worthy bath time pals for the tots.  They enjoy them, which makes the purchase choice a good one.
-1	These toys are fun, but it seems no matter how dry you get them, black mold will eventually form inside.
+1	Our little grandson loves these small, easy to grasp toys in the tub. They don't squirt all that well, but he doesn't care and loves holding and sucking on them anyway! Cute and durable, and for more than just the bath.
+1	Colorful.  My daughter plays with these almost every evening in the bath!  Helps her to identify her marine creatures.
+1	Super cute and fun for bath AND pool! My baby will chew on these little guys and he loves it when I squirt him with them!
+1	These are great toys not just for the bath, but whenever you need noiseless toys for a baby (when someone in the house is still sleeping at 6 AM, for example). I got a laugh out of the octupus--he has SIX tentacles!
+1	When we first bought this toy our son really enjoyed playing with it - in and outside of the bathtub. We introduced him to one of the five figurines at a time, since we knew that he will get eventually bored with them. The figurines are small and fun to hold and look at. They are quality made and have lasted for as long as our interest in them. He still plays occasionally with them, but has now graduated to some more "sophisticated" bath toys.
+1	My child loves these. The dolphin ended up splitting open too much to squirt water anymore but the others work fine. Bright colors and my child enjoys identifying each critter by name.
+1	These make baby happy so momma's happy. My 8 month old likes to chew on them in the bath and LOVES that they squirt. It makes bathing quick and easy when he's happily occupied.
-1	The smell is really strong and the painted parts of the toys are sticky. It feels like they have been made too long ago and are starting to disintegrate. I will not give this to my baby.
+1	These squirt toys are adorable. I originally bought them for the beach, but have since moved them to the bathtub. My 14 month old loves them. They hold quite a bit of water and can have a powerful squirt, so beware once your little one gets the hang of squeezing them.I've seen some reviews complaining about &#34;mold&#34;. I fill mine with a little bathroom cleaner each time I clean the bathroom and rinse them out. So far, I haven't had a problem, but that's the nature of bath toys that you can't reach to clean. They're not expensive so just replace them if it becomes a problem.
+1	Lovely colorful squirting toys ,my daughter loves to play with them while she takes bath .She loves squirting the water from these toys on me and laughs on my reaction :--)
+1	These cute with plastic bath toys were a hit with my grandchildren. They also love to suck on them in their bath.
+1	Great for baths! Or for those babies that love chewing on things lol. I always thing bath toys are fun for lil ones
+1	My son adores these bath toys, their perfect for little hands and he likes to chew on them when he takes baths as well.
+1	Had 'em since my little one turned 6.5 mos old - she's now almost 9 mos -- and she loves chewing on them inside or outside of the bath!
+1	These are so cute and my grand-daughter loves them.  She lines them up on the counter and talks to them.
+1	My daughter loves these toys and looks forward to playing with them in the tub every day. My only concern is the paint on the toys which is starting to come off because my daughter chews on everything. Overall very cute toys.
+1	Our daughter cannot stop chewing these! They are bright, colorful, light, soft but sturdy... very nice product! Would buy again as a gift...
+1	Our 3 year old has had these squirters since he was a baby and he still demands the crab and turtle for his baths.  As a baby I think he liked that they were soft and squishy and colorful.  As a toddler he loves filling them with water and squirting them.  When my niece visits, she loves the dolphin and octopus and together they have loads of fun squirting each other.They are soft enough that my son can still fill them with water when he can't with other squirters.  It's just a great, colorful set.
+1	my 8 mo old has loved these since he was 5 mos or so, his favorite is the crab and the turtle as they are easiest to hold and chew on
+1	The Warm Fuzzy seems to do two very important things for my 16-month old daughter: 1) It makes the BOB more comfortable for her. She fits better in the stroller and lasts much longer in it now that we have the Warm Fuzzy; and 2) It also seems to keep her warmer. The canvas material of the BOB can get quite cold during the early mornings and this does a fine job of blocking out the cold.My only complaint is that it's so expensive. The BOB is already a high-ticket item and this warm fuzzy, at least in our experience, seems to be essential.
+1	My son is so comfortable with this. He snoozed in his stroller today during lunch, something that just wouldn't happen if this wasn't in there! I like that it velcroes. I fold my bob up and everything with it attached with no prob, I just leave it in all the time. It's May and we are still using it. I will probably turn it around for summer the extra padding is so great.I have seen other stroller pads but this one is SO nice. I get compliments often!Seriously though, it really is overpriced..Oh well. Maybe Bob knows i'll buy it anyways because I want the best for my son..
+1	This is nice accessory, I'm happy that I ordered it. It makes the seat more comfortable, and also protects the seat, it's easy to wash. The material could be better quality, it feels a bit cheap... And for the steep price, I would have expected better. Still, it's the only one designed for this seat and it fits perfectly, for me it's an essential with my BOB. Bottom line, I would recommend it.
+1	Works well to pad our Bob Revolution SE for our 5 month old. It can be reversed for the quilted side as well.
+1	This is a must purchase for your Bob as the cooler weather approaches. We purchased this and the wind/rain screen. Both are excellent products; fit the Bob perfectly. Our son can enjoy the outdoors in snuggly comfort (and his mom can still exercise in the winter!).
+1	My teething baby LOVES to chew on this.  I am not sure how much she is &#34;brushing&#34; but this is one of her favorite things to chew on.  It must feel good on her gums. The handle is also just the right size for her to hold onto.
+1	Not sure how good of a toothbrush it is but my daughter loves to put it in her mouth and chew on it (she is 11 months).  We have been &#34;using&#34; (chewing&#34; on it for a couple of months now with no damage.
+1	My younger son loves to chew on this brush. However, it is not a true baby toothbrush in a sense that you won't be able to move it in his mouth. But with that adjustment to expectations it is a great &#34;chewie&#34;.
+1	My baby used her pink one so much from ~5-12 months that I purchased two more in clear.  These things are IMPOSSIBLE to find when they are not colored.  DO NOT buy them in clear... spend the extra 2 bucks for pink or blue.That said, these are the best teethers.  I would dab a little baby toothpaste on it, and my little one would go to town.  I could even substitute it for her binky and know that her teeth were getting cleaned at the same time.  It is soft enough where I never worried about her hurting herself walking with it, and the shape makes it impossible to choke on.  The little loop at the end is perfect for babies little fingers to hold on to.
+1	gave this to my daughter cause she was teething like crazy (3 teeth at once poor girl.) she started using it right away.
+1	My baby uses this as a teether.  it is the right size for her little hands and she seems to like the bristles.
-1	my son prefers the banana looking toothbrush - but all babies are different of course.  we still have it in case he outgrows the banana one
+1	I really wasn't sure about this when I bought it, but my 9 month old has six teeth so dental hygiene needs to be incorporated. Other items I've offered him to chew have been touch and go, which is why I was hesitant about this product: just because it is designed for a baby to chew doesn't mean he's going to chew it. In fact, while I was opening the package he was already chewing on something else he seemed to find wildly satisfying. Yet when I handed him this toothbrush he became immediately intrigued, set down the other object and went to town on the toothbrush! I could hear his little teeth squeaking against the nubby bristles, and it seemed that the shape was able to get good coverage on both front and back.Rad item. Totally glad I bought it.
+1	When my doctor told me that brushing my daughter's teeth would help them break through the gums, I purchased this tooth brush.  The first few times we used it, my daughter would let me rub it back and forth over her gums.  Now she doesn't want my help and even though she chews more than brushes, she loves it.  She will "brush" in 5-10 minute intervals (she doesn't give this much attention to any other toy or teether).  If anything, I think it is a great tool to begin teaching dental care at a young age.
+1	This is the best &#34;teether&#34;gets in the tough areas and he doesn't realize he is brushing his teeth.I have a million teethers and toothbrushes. This is the ONE to buy
+1	We give him this after the iron supplement to prevent teeth coloring. He won't let us brush his teeth with the silicon "brush", but he will immediately start chewing this on his own. He loves it.
+1	My son loves these types of toothbrushes and I let him chew on it after a meal or snack.  I help him with a regular toothbrush, but this one does a great job so he can get the back properly - kind of tough for me to do with a toddler who loves to run around.  Glad he likes this one and it feels good on his molars.
+1	I was skeptical in purchasing this. But my 9 month old son loves it and it has helped his first 2 teeth to come through.  I hope he will continue to use it when the teeth all start coming in.This was a great purchase.
+1	I bought this brush for my son after reading the reviews for this product. My 15-month-old loves this brush. We used to have so much trouble when we try to help him brush his teeth at night and in the AM. He wouldn't let us stick our fingers in when we try to brush using the finger brush. After introducing to this brush, he would brush on his own while seeing us brush. Sometimes we would switch back to those finger brush when we want to do it for him, and he would be willing to open up. Now he thinks brushing is fun. Surprising, after using this brush, he was also able to break from his pacificer. I think this could be purely a coincident, but it worked. He now chews on the brush instead of sucking on the pacifier, and it's much easier to take away compare to the pacifier.
+1	Baby has 4 front teeth in and loved using anything to naw on to help. The back teeth are coming in, baby wakes up in the middle of the night crying from pain and the only that helps, is this toothbrush, which she loves to use for brushing her teeth also. I think the angle of the toothbrush is able to massage the back gums where the tooth is coming in. This works great as a toothbrush and as a back of the mouth teether.
+1	I don't think this works so great as a tooth brush but it is a great chew toy in the tub.  I put a bead of toothpaste on it at times.  It is very soft and very chew friendly.  I is my son's favorite toy in the tub and great for teething babies.
+1	This teether works great when the baby can hold it himself. 7 month and up. Our son used it before as he started to teeth earlier, we would hold it for him. But now as he is able to do it himself he uses this brush every day, it is perfect for theose sore gums. We attached it to the pacifier string with clip and our baby uses it all day! Unlike other brushes it is safe from both ends, it doesn' fall apart in baby's mouth and it is soft, so that if he falls down, he won't injure himself if the brufh is in his mouth. Moreover the lashes of the brush are just right and perfect for teething. Thank you, Amazon!
+1	he likes chewing this.  we let him have it for several minutes at a time, which produces a lot of saliva thus 'washing' his teeth.  we will probably get 1-2 more since he wanders around the house with it in his mouth and would also get one for a friend of his.
+1	I gave this toothbrush to my baby girl when she was 4 months old.  She wanted to put everything in her mouth so it was only natural that when I handed it to her the first time, that's where it went.  It has a nice large handle for her little hands, and it was large enough that she could not stick it far back to choke.  She loved chewing it/ brushing from the very beginning. At first, she did not get the "brushes" in the correct position, but she had no teeth yet, so i did not concern myself with the positioning.  Over time, though, she has managed to figure it out on her own.  I use it everyday, right before bath time. I let her chew on it while I'm setting up the bath and it has become part of our bath time routine.  I do it right before bath time because when she chews on the brush, she gets drool everywhere. I consider the drooling as part of the cleaning process. That way, she's all clean after her bath. She's now 8 months old, still no teeth, but she still loves to chew on the brush as it massages her gums. Since she has no teeth, I cannot say how well it cleans teeth, but I will update this review when her teeth does come out.  I am not sure this "toothbrush" is intended for those with a full mouth of teeth, and eating lots of real adult food.  I originally wanted something to just clean her baby gums and her tongue, which would get a white film from the milk she was drinking. I tried wiping her mouth with a washcloth, but it was a real struggle with a small baby.  This made it so easy when she could hold it and do the cleaning herself.  The swishing around in her mouth cleaned both her gums and her tongue.  So I highly recommend parents to start using this early according the packaging's minimum age, which is 4 months, and those with older children to look elsewhere.
+1	This is a great toothbrush for babies, however my baby uses it as a teether, which is fine.....is it a must? Not for me but its nice to have.
+1	she loves massaging her gum with this all the time. wished it was more pink than purple.
+1	My baby can not do without it, but this is not a toy and can't leave it with baby alone!
+1	I purchased several toothbrushes for my son in the past and this one is much better than any of them. My son is 10 months now and has 6 teeth, somehow he managed to bit off peaces of other toothbrushes, but not this one...he really enjoys it!
+1	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.
+1	The item description as "Baby's 1st Toothbrush" is really sort of a misnomer ... this isn't really a toothbrush in the sense that you would actively use it to clean your baby's first sprouting teeth. However, it is more of a chew toy and has unique bristles in it that possibly COULD help clean your baby's teeth / massage their gums as they play with it.Knowing that, this toy is really great. It has a small form factor (about as long as an adult finger), is soft, and of cource the neccessary BPA, lead and phthalate free.It's a perfect little gift for that baby who is starting to teeth or has a sprouted a couple pearly whites already.I also appreciate the fact that the handle has a hole in it, so that i can attach this toy to a tether when my baby's in her stroller.
+1	Fantastic! My 7 month old loves to gnaw on his new toothbrush and I am so happy we are beginning these wonderful habits now. He is teething, with teeth coming any day now so this has been a welcomed soother without having to freeze his hands holding a standard water filled tether. I do recommend having a spare as they are easy to loose! :-) Dog grabbed one too... darn it! I also recommend NOT leaving baby along with this to avoid any choking issues. I'm sure the packaging states this as well but important to repeat. This is a great product and is 3-4 bucks more at retail baby stores. I also like that my son is doing the 'brushing' verse me putting a finger brush on and putting my fingers in his mouth. He can bite! LOL... Only improvement? Make the loop bigger to prevent the brush from going into their mouth too much.
+1	I have 8 month old twins that LOVE this toothbrush. They showed signs of teething since 2 months, and have always loved to chew on them, but now that teeth are starting to come in, they appreciate them even more! I've read reviews saying that it is too big or too small.. but it seems like it is designed so that the baby can hold and chew on it while getting used to the feeling of it rubbing their teeth.. it is a good step towards transitioning to an actual toothbrush, but a bit hard for an adult to hold and use to brush their baby's teeth. Definitely recommend this product though, as my twins LOVE it.
+1	I keep this attached to links and keep with my babies stroller. She has two bottom teeth that are a few millimeters in, and loves chewing on this. I like that its multipurpose, it's fun to chew on and it simulates the feeling of having your teeth brushed.
+1	My little one loves to brush her teeth with the Baby Buddy.  All the other reviewers that gave good feedback were right.  because of the handle design she grips the brush like the baby on the package, and chews and brushes happily for 10 minutes, massaging gums and her tooth (well now two teeth).  It makes a nice second brush that I can hand her mid day after nursing or a snack.
+1	our little one loves the way it feels on her gums and teeth, that every time we carry her into the bathroom she spits out her pacifier in anticipation for it!
-1	We aren't really sure that this is working or not.  I think this is more for the concept of brushing teeth more than anything. I have been disappointed.
+1	I was very skeptical of this toothbrush being that it's just made of silicone.  My son was having fits with a real toothbrush though so I was willing to try just about anything to help ease the trouble of brushing his 18mth old teeth.  I have to say that I am impressed.  We brush his teeth 3 times a day with this brush and his teeth have stayed nice and white.  We use toothpaste in the AM and PM and just water in the mid day brushing.  He LOVES to just chew and move this around on his teeth and he has all of his teeth now at 20mths and still loves to chew and use this over the regular toothbrush.  For now we will keep using this and see what the dentist has to say when we go for our first checkup in a few months.  But I would HIGHLY recommend this product if your child has any issues with brushing their teeth.  I am not sure what some of the other parents are talking about with it being a choking hazzard because it's not that small.  I would definitely supervise my child while they brush their teeth no matter what brush you give them anyway.  This is a definite keeper :o)
-1	We were disappointed in this product. My baby was 8 months at the time of purchase, liked paci's & chewing on pretty much anything she could get her hands on. She chewed on this 30 seconds & tossed it. I continued to re-introduce it to her over a couple days and she just had no interest. I tried an organic toothpaste she likes on the "toothbrush" which helped her chew it for a minute; however, even with guidance, the bristles did not wrap around teeth/gums in order to work properly. For this reason, the "first toothbrush" is lucky to get 2 stars. I am sure it helps brush other children's teeth when a child will chew it long enough, otherwise, I recommend just using a washcloth or the finger toothbrush.
+1	My daughter LOVED this toothbrush. She is 2 now and has upgraded, but we used this A LOT. I would give it to her, and she did all the work. Sometimes she just liked to have something in her mouth, so this served that purpose as well. I loved the soft "bristles". They were perfect and worked well.The perfect starter toothbrush!
+1	My son LOVES this thing. He is 1 and it brushes and lets him chew at the sr time. We put them in the freezer so they are nice and cold. Perfect 1st toothbrush!!!
+1	This was the first &#34;teether&#34; my baby would use (at about 4 months).  She is now 10 mos. and still loves to chew on it.  The only problem I see is that I decided to purchase the clear one, which is sometimes hard to find amidst her toys.
+1	The first time I gave my son this tooth brush, it went in his mouth, and he turned it the right way so it wrapped around his teeth.  I had it to him as I'm getting the bath ready and he chews and chews on it until I take it away.  I think this is a wonderful, natural way for baby to learn to &#34;brush&#34; their teeth.  Can't beat it for the price!!
+1	Before we found this, brushing our baby's teeth was a struggle. But she actually enjoys it when we brush her teeth with this toothbrush. Definitely recommend this!
+1	I love my daughter and was very surprised to find out she could have stinky breath.  My beautiful little angel had bad breath?  What?  Well, that was when I knew that I needed to be better about brushing her emerging teeth.  Wiping them with a clean washcloth was difficult, and I would 'forget' to do it all the time.  This toothbrush filled the need perfectly, without requiring a lot of effort on my part (I'm not lazy, but let's be honest - there's a lot to do when you have an infant!) and took care of her stinky breath.  Which led me to believe that her teeth were also getting clean.She also loved chewing on it, and I think it helped with her teething.  Especially when she started to cut molars - that brush could angle towards the back and she could chew away!  We have 2, and I would recommend them highly!
+1	My 6 month old loves this! It is has very soft bristles perfect for tender gums. He chews this longer than anything else. I think this is better for smaller babies with few or no teeth.
+1	worked well.  held up well.  used for my first born and he love to shew it so got for his brother.  He's not as excied about it but atill uses it.
+1	What a great purchase.  I buy tons of things for my 7 month old son and he loves this.  We now call him DDS since he will brush his two teeth all the time.  Great for little hands to hold and he can get it in his mouth easily.  He loves to chew on it and I got it when he was 6 months old.Highly recommend!
+1	We've only taken it on 1 round-trip flight but I am so glad that we had it - I wanted to take our Bob but not potentially sacrifice the stroller with the way things get handled when they're loaded into the planes. This protected the stroller and held up well.
+1	I bought this sheep out of desperation when my girl was a newborn. She ignored it completely. Now that she is 8 months old, I tried it again, and it is amazing. The noises captivate her as I am petting her and trying to get her to sleep. She concentrates on it instead of on freaking out (she really just does not want to sleep, ever). It helps me get her to sleep. One of the weird things is the timing on this.. instead of a half hour and a full hour, it gives 25 minutes and 43.. it seems like it is just random. I like that it turns off so that we can save batteries, but I almost wish that there was an option not to. In the afternoon, once the sound goes, she wakes up.It has a great velcro feature in the back, so we can secure it safely to a crib or bassinet, for newborns.A great thing, this sheep.Heck, it puts ME to sleep while I'm holding her. An adult with insomnia might even consider owning it.2 YEAR OLD UPDATEMy daughter is STILL using this sheep. I have put it through the wash (though it says not to, sometimes you just have to), and she listens to it -every night-. She can't go to sleep without it. The only thing that has changed is that it runs through batteries a little faster than it used to, but it is still going strong.
+1	He loves the playful sounds the most but the waterfall keeps him settled when I first lay him down.  It seems to run for a long time before turning off too which is nice.  And I LOVE that it has a Velcro strap so that if we take it on the go, he can't throw it our of the stroller.
+1	Can take out the sound machine and use as a soft toy as well. Baby enjoys this, but doesn't fall asleep. It seemed to help him sleep longer when he was a newborn, but since around 5 months he didn't react to it. He still loves to play with the sheep and snuggle with it.  Definitely would recommend a crib soother once your baby stops reacting with this.
+1	We received this soft, cute sheep as a gift for our newborn. I never realized how much I'd like the noise as well--it helped me concentrate on something other than every little grunt and snort she made, helping me get some rest too. The Velcro strap allows me to place it near her but not worry about it falling into the bassinet. The batteries have a great lifespan. I would only change one thing: I wish it had a continuous option because it sometimes bothers me when it shuts off and I wonder if it might disturb baby too. I recommend this to any parent, especially first-timers who might need some help relaxing while baby gets to sleep.
+1	Not only is this Sleep Sheep super soft the sound is great!!  Volume is easily adjusted and gets pretty loud even tho the speaker is inside the sheep.  I really like the different timers you can set but for our little budndle of joy I wish it were longer. Regardless our 4mo old sleeps so much better with a little sound and we use the Rain and Ocean regularly.  This is a must buy for light sleepers since it really does a great job of hiding outside noise from cars and neighbors and even if your baby sleeps like a rock this Sleep Sheep is a great for calming down those fussy moments !!! &#60;3
+1	The soothing noises were a lifesaver with a newborn.  It helped her fall fast asleep.  It also helped mother and father relax a little bit too.  Also, the texture of the animal is the best I have ever felt. I image I can remove the sound box from the back (velcro'd in) once she is done with that portion and let her play with just the animal alone.
+1	We got this for our 3 month old at Christmas & he loves it! We have no complaints other than the sounds aren't exactly as they sound in the description. To us they sound more like someone breathing, a water feature, crickets on a summer's night, & a jungle groove over a campfire...LOL! But the freaky one of someone breathing holds him over until he is deeply asleep. I love the option of going longer than 20 minutes, at the 23 min timer he wakes up, but the 45 minute timer is perfect! And I don't know why we would ever get the smaller travel version. I like that his giraffe is big & cuddly...so does he! This normal size one has a velcro loop so you can take it anywhere!
+1	Love the music, the look, the feel.  Love this toy. We have the sleep sheep as well and I prefer the music choices on this one.
+1	My baby loved it so much it almost felt like cheating. If my baby was changed and fed but was still not happy I would turn this sheep on the setting that sounds like mother's heartbeat when she was still in the belly and she would calm right down and go to sleep. It is very soft and my baby loved looking at it. It has several sound settings - of which she loved the heartbeat the best.
+1	This is a staple now in our nursery. Baby LOVED this... I put it on while I am nursing him, and by the time he is done, he is sooooo sleepy! I leave it on for the 45 minute timer, and he has been sleeping through the night ever since!
+1	I bought this for my son as he is unable to sleep without some sort of white noise.  The heartbeat sound is way too slow to fool him and he doesn't care for the whale sound but the rain and ocean are great.His favorite sound is the ocean and he has no trouble falling asleep until the timer runs out and within minutes of being in silence he wakes up and we have to start all over.I like how soft and cuddly the sheep is and how easy it hangs from the crib.  It is easy to remove the sound box for washing too.  I just wish that it could play the sound until manually turned off (or until battery dies)
+1	I love this giraffe it is a life savor and one of my child's favorite things. I am so glad I bought this and will be holding on to it for any more future children.
+1	This is such a sweet little lamb that makes soothing sounds to comfort infants. It's every bit as cute and cuddly as the picture.
-1	This product works and helps my baby get off to sleep.  BUT!!! As soon as the 45 minutes is up the sound shuts off and my baby wakes up.  If anyone knows how to make it go continuously, please let me know!
+1	My wife and I got this as a gift for our second child. We really like this a lot, especially if you believe in white noise helping a baby sleep.  We live in a noisy environment (daytime hours), so this is helpful in putting the baby down for a nap.Besides the softness and cute design of a sheep, it is designed well because it is easy to 'install' on a crib or play-yard.  The noise selections are great as is the timer option.  Our newborn is sleeping in our room right now, and we even appreciated the noise.We like this so much, we would give it as a gift in a heartbeat.
+1	This Is a great product. The sleep sheep is very soothing for baby. We love the heart beat sound. It helps the baby settle down in his crib. I would recommend to other parents.
+1	BEST GIFT ever, between this and the merlin sleep suit....two favorite items he got for Christmas. The settings are all nice and he giggles at the whale noises but it's the mother's heart beat that my son loves. We co-slept in the beginning and &#34;darth vader&#34; (my nickname for the sheep because the mothers heart beat reminds me of darth vader breathing after a while) came to bed with us every night. now he's switching to his pack and play and I just turn it on when I'm going to set him down and he stays asleep till he needs to eat, then I put him right back with it on and he sleeps right away, without it he wakes up instantly and it's back to getting him sleepy again for hours....I don't know what I'd do without this sheep....oh wait yes I do....I'd be insane from lack of sleep....Age started use: 3 months, currently 4 months and 3 weeksProsSo Soft and fluffyThe timer being able to be set to 45 or 25....most don't allow past 25 and it takes the longer setting for my son to get into his deep sleepthe strap that you can velcro around the crib/pack and play, I like it because he can't grab it and pull it to his face like he does with all his other toys so I can sleep without worry of him suffocating with itCons:picks up lint like crazy, so be sure to keep it in a clean spotWish you could have an hour or more timer optionthe ocean and whale noises practically the same thing....would have been nice to have another option but I really only use the heart beat anywaysBulky for travel and the travel version does not have the heart beat....and we travel a lot....but what I've done is just pop out the sound machine and take that only on the plane or out in the stroller, then put it back in when we reach out destination.Con's not enough to bring it down a star because in the end, it's a miracle worker and I know my son would be having a much harder time transitioning to his pack and play without it right now. I LOVE this sheep
+1	I received this as a gift at my baby shower.  It has become my favorite baby item (rating up there with my Aden and Anais blankets!). First, the sheep itself is adorable.  However, more importantly, it has four buttons with soothing sounds for baby.  The best sound for a newborn: the heartbeat.  I put my (now 2 months old) baby in his basinet and immediate turn on the heartbeat.  It creates a peaceful environment for him and allows him to fall asleep without hearing my heartbeat (mommas and dads need sleep too!).  The other sounds are lovely as well (rain and whale).This sheep hooks right on to the outside of the crib (important because you don't want anything in there for risk of suffocation).  Someday, when my child is older, you can take the hard sound box right out, zip the sheep back up, and voila - he is a soft little stuffed animal.If you are registering for a baby shower or attending one, this is truly a top notch gift.
+1	great white noise machine. not much else to say. it's cute. my babies are too young to have noticed it but it looks great on the crib, is soft and of high quality and the sounds you can choose from are perfect.
-1	Sure it's a cute little sheep - but it only makes white noise for a set period (max 45 mins if I recall correctly). When the noise stops, the baby would wake up.  Thus we spent 99 cents on a white noise track from itunes and run it in a continuous loop.  Much cheaper and effective.
+1	This wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it is very cute. The part of it that makes the sounds is a bit bulky. Its very soft and has a velcro tab to wrap around the crib and there is a timer for the sounds to play.
+1	Allow me to just agree with those who love this.  My infant son loves this.  We sent one to day care when he started there and before you know it several other kids have one.  The teachers love it - the sounds really help the kids get to sleep and it's a good toy for them to cuddle up too.  It worked so well we bought a second one for home.  It's been a big help for us at nap time (particularly when we are off his schedule or away from home - he knows when we pull it out and turn it on that it's time to take a nap).
+1	Great item. Has nice sounds and is very very soft.Our boy likes it a lot as does his cousins (gifts).
+1	Sound machine AND adorable stuffed animal in one? Win-win. I love that the sound machine is removable for travel, because the sheep is pretty big. I don't use it all the time, and didn't even get it until my daughter was 3 and 1/2 months old, but it helps when she's worked up and fussy around bedtime ("overstimulated" would probably be the technical term). I imagine it would have helped her fall back asleep after eating in the middle of the night back when she was still doing that. I like giving baby gifts that are cute and practical, and this definitely fits the bill.
+1	I love the Sleep Sheep.  It still helps my 8 month old daughter get to sleep at night.  I usually put it on the "rain" or "ocean" sounds as the "whale" and "heartbeat" are kind of strange and not very soothing.  She definitely falls asleep and stays asleep much better with it on.  It is especially useful when she gets up in the middle of the night to nurse and is still fairly sleepy.  It helps her go right back to sleep without a problem when I lay her back down in her crib.  We have been using the Sleep Sheep since my daughter was born and came home from the hospital as a preemie.  I highly recommend this product to new parents.  White noise is wonderful thing when you have a fussy baby who doesn't sleep well.
+1	I love the sleep sheep. My baby turns to it whenever he actually decides to stay in his crib. There are a variety of soothing sounds to choose from to help calm/soothe baby. Not the mention the sheep is pretty cute as well. This is also a perfect neutral item.
-1	I love the concept and look of the Sleep Sheep, but there are a couple of features that I don't care for. Firstly, the sheep is on a 25 or 45 minute timer (which may work for some kids) but I really need something that runs all night. My baby wakes up as soon as it goes off. Plus, the only sound that is continuous (like a whooshing, and the only I can stand listening to since he sleeps in our room) is the rain setting. (Mother's heartbeat is just creepy... not conceptually, just this particular version) The other sounds are obnoxious and distracting- especially the whales, though my husband likes them. I guess I should have just used my current alarm clock on rain setting all night. Lastly, it needs to be much louder! All that said, I do use it- and could see other families having no problems. At $30 or whatever, it is worth the "gamble."
+1	It is a very very nice product. It works for my infant baby. My baby barely can open her eyes when the ocean is turning on. I love the sheep. Of course it is bigger than I expected, but anyway, the sheep is a very good sleep-helper.
+1	I think it's cute. The dial controls the sound very well. I like the several options of noises although the whale one is just weird. I love that there are two timer lengths. It hooks on our crib easily. I would buy this as a gift.
+1	we had the sleep sheep with our first and now the Gentle Giraffe with our second.  I think that this is cuter than the sheep.  Sounds are great - like it shuts off after 20 or 40 minutes.  Not too loud.  Great size.
+1	We didn't use this for very long...(maybe until son was a month) but it was wonderful.  The whales sound lulled him right to sleep.  I plan on getting one of these for shower gifts for every pregnant woman I know!
+1	The sleep sheep has been a staple of our sleep routine since the beginning. After using it steadily for a year, the sound box stopped working. As soon as I contacted Cloud B, they sent us a replacement sound box, no problem.We like the ocean sound best and rain is very nice but really haven't used the other sounds. I do wish it had an option for night-long sound.As a tip, when we travel, we take the sound box along so she has the continuity of the same sounds to fall asleep to. No need to find room to pack the whole sheep.
-1	You may want to try this sheep for yourself, but it did not work for my son. He is now almost 4 months old and he has not cared about this sheep and its sounds from day one. I have the soothing seahorse and aquarium soother and both of these put my child to sleep fast. I would recommend those products, but not the sleep sheep.  What attracts him most is the light and he prefers songs to the sounds of the sheep. I give 2 stars to the sheep just because it is super cute and I think we can use it later as a toy. It is also very soft, so I think my son will eventually like it once he can hold things.
+1	The Sleep Sheep is now a necessity for sleep at our house.  The soothing sounds that the sheep produces effectively elliminates the noises that would potentially wake our baby allowing us to carry on normal routine household tasks while our baby sleeps.
+1	We've been using this giraffe for over6 months now with no problems at all.I'd say that we turn the noise makerpart on about 6-10 times a day, every day.The giraffe is super soft, buttons areeasy to reach and I like the variety ofsounds that can fit just about any timeof day whether playing or sleeping.  Evenwith this much use, we've only had toreplace the batteries once.
+1	I received this as a baby shower gift and my daughter loves it still at 22 months old.  We use it every night!
+1	This has been a life saver with our newborn who is very specific about what kind of white noise she likes if she's fussy. We keep this larger one attached to her crib so that when we lay her down in the crib we can flick this on to one of the sound settings and let it play for 23 or 45 mins, we always leave it on 45 minutes to play the longest it can. Four sounds come with the giraffe (which looks so cute in her safari themed nursery).Sleep - sounds like rushing water.Relax - Bubbling stream with occasional quiet nature sounds like tweeting birds.Calm - Slightly louder nature sounds like insects, birds tweeting and an occasional growl over low quiet drum beats.Play - More rapid fun drum beat with some jazzy insect noises and a ribbiting frog.It's very cute and effective, we switch between sleep and relax when she's napping and I know as she gets older the Calm and Play sounds will be fun for her! I also love that it attaches securely to the outside of the crib with a very strong velcro strap!
-1	We bought this item to use in our nursery. The sleep sheep arrived in what appeared to be great condition and was really cute.  Unfortunately, the screws used by the manufacturing company are so cheap, we stripped them by lightly applying pressure with the screw driver.  We were able to get one out, but not the other.  I can't comment on how the item works since we weren't able to gain access to the battery compartment.
+1	The 'waterfall' or white noise is perfect for naptime and bedtime.  It helps drown out background house noises and offers a sleepytime cue that helps our routine.
-1	It's cute and we were gifted 3 different versions, unfortunately it doesn't work nearly as well as a less-cute but also half-priced basic, white noise machine.This machine only runs for a max 45 minutes and my daughter woke up EVERY TIME it shut off. Now it just hangs in her room for decoration and we use the much more functional version from Brookstone.ps, if you're considering the giraffe, it looks like its neck was snapped not like it's sleeping peacefully
+1	It works amazingly to calm and sooth our 8 week old. I used to have trouble getting her to nap during the day and it is so calming for her to relax to fall asleep. A great product!
-1	The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped. It has several noises and I thought one of them would be similar to "white noise" which is what I use at night to help my baby sleep. Not crazy about the sounds.
+1	Love the sounds, love that it is plush, and love the velcro strap. My daughter is almost a year and we use it every night. I like that it shuts off after a time period. I only wish there was a button to turn it off if you accidentally push the button (like in the car).
+1	This is really cute, soft, and most of the noises are pleasant and natural sounding (we like the rain and ocean settings). The volume control is perfect and allows you to set it to exactly what you need. I just wish there was an simple on / off without a timer feature as well. The timer is nice for older kids or adults who just need it to fall asleep initially (can play 23 or 45 minutes) but for babies like mine who go down for naps or night and awaken several times this isn't ideal. They can't turn it back on to help themselves fall back to sleep. If I remember to keep going in the room and turning it back on every 45 minutes, then when little one awakes after an hour of napping or at night he'll fall right back to sleep in less than a minute. If it turned off and I forgot to turn it back on though, baby wakes to the silence, gets scared and is up screaming and nap time is over. So, cute but for young babes I'd recommend the simple sound machines that have continuous play features.
+1	My Situation:I was a new mom of a 1 and a half month old, desperate for ANYTHING to help my son start sleeping for longer increments.PROS:- Adorable product. It even matched my son's giraffe themed room. And even when you don't need it for the soothing sleep sounds, it is still a really cute stuffed animal.- Well made and SO SOFT.- Has a strap on the back of him so you can attach him to the side of your crib, or somewhere in a vehicle for travel.- Battery pack and all of the buttons for the different noises are on the back as well.- This has volume control and gets really loud.- Four different sounds: a silly little jungle song/beat, a "waterfall" that sounds more like white noise, a "womb" sound that sounds more like a distorted heartbeat, and a jungle sounds option with frogs chirping, etc. The sounds play for 45 minutes before automatically shutting off, which REALLY helps in getting your little one to sleep. We play the waterfall one on really low volume to help get our son to sleep.- It comes with a short story book about the giraffe itself. Nothing fancy, but a cool plus for your money.CONS:- Some of the sounds are silly and kind of pointless, but not a terrible con. Nothing else I dislike about this toy.Conclusion/How it Helped us:I give it 4 stars because I can't really say FOR SURE that this toy is the reason my son started sleeping through the night. We got this when my son was a month and a half old. A week later, he started sleeping through the night, and I mean 12+ hours at a time. To this day (5 months later) he sleeps for that long, and we actually have to wake him up to change his diaper and feed him so he doesnt wake up completely soiled and starving! lol. It could just be a coincidence with the purchase timing of this product, but I do believe that by playing the waterfall option on this right before I set my son down in his crib, it really helped him get to a deeper sleep before it shuts off. My son is now 6 months old next week, and on normal nights we no longer use this toy to assist in getting him to sleep, but he is teething right now and sometimes really resists us on naptime, so with the addition of a couple drops of tylenol, and a little baby orajel for his gums, we turn this on and he konks right out. Nonetheless, whether this was the reason or not for his awesome sleep habits, I don't regret this purchase. It was an adorable addition to his crib/room, and as he gets older, I anticipate him cuddling with it in his crib or playing with it.
+1	I received the smaller, portable one as a gift and so far, it's been a life saver!I'm a big fan onThe Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longerand subscribe to the 5S theory because it's worked for us as first-time parents.I love this sleep sheep because the sound options are all great and soothing.  I attach it to the bassinet handle at night and during the day, it's small enough to either take with me to the baby's swing or inside the baby's stroller.The only reason I'm leaving off a star is because the longest you can leave it on is for 45 minutes.  I wish there was a longer time option because I notice my baby tends to start moving around and making noises when the machine turns off.  I'm sure this helps conserve battery power if you accidentally left it on but I would love to leave it on through the night, as every parent knows, the longer sleep sessions would be greatly appreciated!I would highly recommend this... would be a perfect shower gift because it's cute and useful!
+1	Only use it on heartbeat mode but he also likes the nature sounds! Love how it goes for 45 mins and you can sneak in push the button again and there is no obvious change to sound or button noises. Beautiful soft cute giraffe and love the dial you turn for noise level! Highly recommend x
+1	Our 2 week old son LOVES this.  We swaddle him up in a miracle blanket and turn this on.  It puts him to sleep almost instantly.  Of the four sounds, I think the heartbeat is most effective, followed by the waves, rain, then whales.
+1	I got this for my 6 week old son to help him calm down and go to sleep at night. I'm not sure that it does much at this point, but I like listening to the "rain" setting. The one thing I am disappointed about is that I bought it for the mother's heartbeat sound, as he likes to lie on my chest and listen to my heartbeat. But it really doesn't sound anything like a heartbeat, so I haven't used that sound much.
-1	I would not buy this product again.  It's very cute and a nice idea but all babies are different and this product didn't work for us. Our Daughter finds the rain noise the most soothing.  The whales, heartbeat and ocean wave options she does not like at all and has never fallen asleep while using those.  We brought this to the hospital and tried using it when she was first born, it didn't work.  I would not buy this product again it was not worth the cost for how little it has helped with our daughter sleeping.  I feel we truly gave this product a good chance (my daughter is now 5 months old) and I am sorry we wasted our money on this.
+1	I love this! My daughter is 9 months old and has used this every day of her life! It was especially good for her while she was in the NICU for 2 months. Just recently the sound machine stopped working, but i contacted customer service at cloud b and they are sending me a new one :) highly recommend!
-1	I purchased this to give as a gift; Sadly, the box arrived dented, and now I can't use this item. Disappointing. This is just one of several packaging problems I've had with amazon over the last month (amazon has not been packaging my items carefully, leading to damaged items). Ugh.
+1	Definitely a worthwhile purchase and helps our 3 month old get to sleep at night and at nap time. I was using a babbling brook track on my phone to lull him to sleep, but that was impractical since I couldn't actually use my phone if it was left in the nursery for soothing purposes. The sleep sheep solved that problem, and he's cute to boot! I do wish it had better/more sound options, though.The ocean waves are my favorite because they are pretty loud and block out other noises. The rain is also nice, but it is too quiet in my opinion. We never use the maternal heartbeat because it is TOO loud and, while the baby might like it, it's pretty annoying to the adult ear. My husband likes the wales setting, but it's a little too spooky for my taste. I guess I'm pretty picky! Anyway, just buy this. Is it essential? No, not really, but it's a nice thing to have. Bonus that it doesn't seem to drain the batteries too quickly either.
+1	I am very happy with this sound machine. It is super soft and way up there on the cuteness factor.  The sounds are nice and my son seems to enjoy them, while cuddlying with the giraffe, although I think he would have enjoyed the dolphin sounds more (I did not discover they had a dolphin until after I had purchased the giraffe.) The giraffe seems to be very well made, no loose pieces or strings anywhere that I could find.  Fur is really nice and soft.  I gave it four stars because the sound box was extremely difficult to get into the giraffe but at least you know it is secure and will not come out, I just dread changing the batteries. =)
+1	The Sleep Sheep makes soothing sounds, although surprisingly does not offer the generic White Noise sound which a lot of infants seem to like.  Unfortunately the Sleep Sheep we received had a defective sound box; when we turned the volume up toward the max, the sound would shut off.  I emailed CloudB about it, and literally within TWO MINUTES, I got a response that said they were sending me a new sound box immediately. Customer Service doesn't get any better than that!
+1	I got this little sweet sheep as a gift for my son.  From just a few weeks of age, he falls asleep to the soothing sounds. He gets calm from it so easily.  The best part is the batteries last a very long time and the sounds play very long.  The only complaint is that you have to turn the whole thing off to stop the sound, rather than being able to push a start/stop button.  Highly recommended!
+1	My home is so quiet at night, apart from random outside noise and my cats going nuts at various hours.  In order to help my daughter sleep through this crazy times, this item helps create the soothing white noise that will help her stay asleep when I put her in her crib.
+1	We put in car, crib and stroller. Our little guy loved it! You may want to get the smaller one if you travel but I wanted louder sound so we went with full size
+1	cute but another waste of money. it got dirty and once your child is old enough it is no use. plus if your child get's use to listening to this then they wont be able to sleep without it.
+1	This is a nice looking giraffe but the sounds could be better. They are not loud enough. Also, the volume control is not that easy to turn especially when you are half asleep at night. It is hard to grab.
+1	This product is amazing!  The monkey noises are why we bought this item. They are funny and cute!  The white noise and water are nice also. The lullaby is a bit annoying, but I'm about to have my first child so I guess I better get used to annoying things. Lol!  It's the perfect size to hang on the side of her crib or take with in the car. I am very glad we bought this. I thought it was a waste of money at first, but it is really cute and useful!
+1	This little guy was one of our baby shower gifts that actually gets daily use.  It's cute, for one, but I really questioned whether or not it did much for my baby.  I don't think it did when she was really small, but the white noise seems to be useful for her now, at nearly four-months old.  We use this basically every time she sleeps, whether a quick power-nap or going down for the night.  We have it strapped to her crib (which she has slept in since before 1 month old) and have used it basically every day and night.  We always use the heartbeat sound since I think for now, having some consistency is probably the most comforting to her.  I think the monotony of the sound is probably best for little babies, too.  The whale sounds seem like they wouldn't be very soothing to anyone, of course, I'm not a baby, so my opinion probably doesn't mean much.Occasionally, once the sound stops, she will actually wake up, but turning it back on and rocking her a minute or less will have her out cold again.  I do wish you could have the sound on longer, for that reason.  I also feel like the plastic switch box is pretty cheaply made and find that the buttons kind of stick in a pressed-in position.  This has not affected being able to play it or anything, yet, but it's kind of annoying and I wonder how much more abuse the heartbeat button will take.Overall, I think that using this regularly comforts her AND she uses this sound as an association for sleeping and calming down.  I used to think I'd just set up and iPod and speakers in her room for white noise sounds, but this sheep has been really convenient and easy for us to push the button and be all set.
+1	I want to give it a higher rating, but my kiddo wasn't impressed. It didn't have the desired effect to help her get to sleep.The sounds are high quality (whales, heart beat, rain, water). Having volume control and timer settings are great.It can be strapped easily to a crib with the velcro behind it's head.Soft, fluffy fur.
+1	We have used this sleep sheep during nap time and bed time for almost a year now for our baby.  The background noise is really soothing for him.  The sound is a bit garbled but it is still a great solution.  There's a velcro strap on the back so it can hang on the side of the crib.
+1	I have used this product for two weeks now with my 2.5 month old son.  We love the fact that it has a 45 minute timer on it, we've never used the 25 minute setting in all honesty.  I wish there were more options for timing settings above 45 minutes or maybe a remote control option so we could turn it back on if need be.I haven't tried any of the other sounds on my little guy, because he seems to love the simple white noise option.  It doesn't have any sort of beat mixed into it, in case you are wondering, it's simply a static-y noise.Originally I was using this too loud and my son would wake up when it shut off.  Now I keep the volume lower so it lulls him to sleep, but he doesn't get jolted awake when it shuts off.I've taken the sound machine itself out of the giraffe and we're using the giraffe as a toy right now.  The sound machine is pretty small and will fit into a tight space if need be.Good purchase in my opinion.  Now, my son is swaddled, in his sling, and with the addition of the white noise he sleeps for 10 hours straight every night!
+1	This is a really nice baby gift. Honestly I thought we would use it more than we so for white noise. The good news is that the noisemaker can come out so she'll enjoy it as a stuffed animal for many years to come.
+1	I got really excited over this and anticipated great results when I purchased it before my son was born.  However it was not until my son was about 10 months old that I was able to use it.  He responds much better to the "rain" and "heart" sounds.  The other sounds seems to be a little disturbing to him.I must admit that my first review was a 2star rating but I must retract that and state that it is really a matter of timing for each child.  Now it is the quickest way to get him off to sleep.  My son fights sleep so this is a charm for us.To those considering the purchase, be mindful that each child is different and will respond differently to various stimuli.  For me the value of this purchase took almost a year for me to see it.  But I surely do now!My major concern is that the other sounds are not easily discerned and as an adult not comforting. My solution, I just don't use those settings.
+1	I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too.  Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off.  I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.**Edit 2/27/13: I had contacted the company about this problem who asked me to send the giraffe back. We did so and have since received a brand new giraffe and are very happy.  I have changed the rating from two stars to five for the satisfying customer service.
-1	Some babies love white noise, but we didn't find this product to be very soothing for our baby.  The heartbeat setting is so slow that it sounds very unnatural.  The whale setting sounds more like haunted house noises.  The rain and ocean noises are the only ones that don't sound creepy.  For us, this was a waste of money.  We had better luck with the Tiny Love Soothe and Groove Mobile, which plays music for 40 minutes, and has several different settings/types of music/white noise from which to choose.
+1	I put this by the bassinet when I put my baby down for naps or for the night and it's awesome.  It has 4 great settings: flowing water, ocean waves, mom's heartbeat, and whale songs.  I love the mom's heasrtbeat for my son.  It really soothes him and keeps him relaxed when I put him down.  I woudl recommend this to anyone with an infant.  It's a real lifesaver.  I may have to by the travel size as well for when we visit family.  It's a must have.
+1	Love this! We started using the mother's heartbeat at night when we got home from the hospital & it's become a part of our baby's bed routine. We found it to be immediately soothing to our baby. Highly recommend it!
+1	I purchased this for my son prior to his birth and have used it since day 1.  I have used the heartbeat noise almost exclusively for putting him to sleep however when playing in his room he will now hit the buttons and try the other noises.  originally I had this hanging by the velcro on his crib but once he woke up in the morning (starting at 9 months) he would un-velcro and it would either be in his crib or on the floor.  I started putting it on the table near his crib and that worked best for me, I could easily hit the button if I needed more time on particularly fussy nights and it was out and being adorable.  He has other non-noise animals to sleep with. I have had it and used it every night for 17 1/2 months and only changed the batteries 1 time.  We love this also because when we travel it provides comfort and familiarity for him.
+1	This is the perfect sound machine for a baby's room....helps block out sounds that could wake baby.  Plays for up to 45 minutes which is really nice.  It's great because you can bring it with you when you are traveling...packs well.Not a fan of the whale sound option but the rest are great!
+1	i got this in the mail a few days a go and my toddler loves playing with it.  i have been trying to tell her its for the new baby but she loves it and the sounds it makes.  i might have to get another one for her cause she loves taking it to bed and cuddleing it.  i really like the lamb a lot.  i like that it has eight sounds and easy to use.  i like the nature sounds and the lullbuys to it plays.  i like that it have vaulme control and it doesnt play that loud and u can set a timmer for 25min and 45 min
+1	we bought this almost a year ago- when my daughter was just a couple weeks old. we have used it at every nap and bedtime (if we were home) she LOVES the ocean waves, but the whales make her fussy. anyway- when she was newborn, the sound would immediately put her to sleep, now, when we lay her down and turn on her sheep she just rolls over and listens til she falls asleep. she can and does sleep without her sheep, but with two other kids in the house i needed something to drown out the constant noise, and this did the trick. i still have it attached at the foot of her crib, hanging from the top, facing her, i just push the button through the slats of her crib, no problem at all.batteries last a very long time, volume goes up much higher than i have ever needed, you can have it on for 23 or 45 minutes, usually 10 is plenty for us. definitely would recommend this sheep.
+1	we love the Sleep Sheep! For now, we only use the ocean sound and it is a great help in getting our daughter to sleep. The only downside is that you feel sleepy as well... I also don't get the heart sound, it's just weird that it's not the double-beat, but a single-beat instead...
+1	We didn't know that white noise would be such a life-saver in getting our newborn/infant son to sleep, but once we did, we used iPhone/iPad apps and the vacuum/washer/dryer for white noise.  Then we got this as a gift and we LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Didn't know about these before and wish we had!!  The white noise apps just drain the battery on your devices really quickly, and of course you don't want to spend your life sitting next to the dryer or vacuum.  We actually got a second one so we'd have one for trips in the car (attached to the car seat) and one for the crib/nursery.  That is how much we like this and how much it helps our son.  A friend of mine said the same thing, and that her 3 year old still uses his and her almost 1 year old also really benefits from this.  The noise options are nice too (our personal favorite is the ocean, but the rain and the stream options are nice too - the whale one is our least favorite) and we really like the choice between 25 and 45 minutes for the timer.  We use this a lot and the battery seems to last a long time too.Update:We thought that this would be the exact same product as our sleep sheep, but the machine part actually has different noise options than the one that came with the sheep - there are two noises that are the same (rain and ocean, I believe) and there are two that are different.  One is (in our opinion) a really creepy imitation of a kid giggling, and one is a lullaby type song.  I personally wish the noise choices were like our other one, and was very surprised that it was different, but as we used the rain and ocean options the most anyway, it's not too much of an inconvenience.
+1	My toddler cannot go to sleep without the sleep sheep set to ocean sounds.  We've had it in her bed ever since she was 3 months old and we have a travel sheep to take with us when we're away from home.  Excellent to help her feel like she's falling asleep in a familiar place.  When our new baby arrives, we'll be purchasing another one for the new nursery!
-1	This item is a WONDERFUL idea, but it has two key flaws:1) there isn't a continuous play mode!!  There are only two timed options (23 and 45 min), then the sound turns off.  My newborn needed the sound maintained continuously to STAY asleep, not just to FALL asleep.  Thus, we would have to keep pressing the button over and over, waking up ourselves when the sound would turn off to keep her from waking up - beyond annoying.2) the full-size model is enormous - you do not need anything larger than the "on-the-go" or travel model, so why make this so big?  To charge more, that's why.I gave it two stars because it has so much potential to be a fabulous product:--the sheep is adorable, soft, and it is great to be able to hang it from ANYWHERE with the velcro loop.  Plus, it is battery operated, which is a huge blessing (batteries are pre-installed, and are very long lasting - we did not replace ours over three+ months of use).--the way the sound "machine" is removable from the body of the sheep is ingenious.  This way, you can wash the sheep and reinsert the machine when dry.--LOVE the volume control:  it's a dial, so you have complete control (not just low and high like so many children's products today).--The rain sound is the closest to generic "white noise."--This model (the original, or larger model) has the heartbeat sound, crucial for newborns.This product would be perfect with a 1) continuous play mode and 2) a smaller size (e.g., the travel "on-the-go" size).  The latter, of course, would bring the price down equal to the travel size, which is what this product is worth, imo.Due to these factors, you are better off with Brookstone's sound machine, which has not only timed settings, but also continuous play, AND all the sounds you really need:  heartbeat, in-utero (weird sloshing sound with "glub-glubs"), white noise, automobile and more. It's not cute and plush (and you have to plug it in w/ battery backup), but is WORKS.
+1	This lamb is so perfect and can't put it into words! First of all, the material is so soft and the features of the lamb are so sweet. It has a crib strap and the music box is completely removable for washing and so simple to do. My New Grandbaby about loves and coo's to it. Her favorite sound is the heartbeat and fell so fast asleep! her other favorite sound is the whale songs. The music box has different sounds which can be volumed up or down, and has two different timers to set. It was so important to me to find a nursery product that has a womb heartbeat, this has it and more! Absolutely love this lamb!
+1	...and also the fact that it has a timer it's horrible...I mean if it also had the possibility to stay on longer than 45min it would be great...I finished buying one that you could leave on and plug in and I am using the insert in the sheep for the stroller naps when I am in the stores and the noises would wake up the light sleeper baby :)
+1	This is the best fan out there! It's a must on hot days! I Bought it for my baby for disney world wouldn't of survived without it! My sister had the other one that looked similar and hers was horrible! This fan was awesome! Strong too!
+1	I had a HARD time finding a fan like this. I wanted it for our trip to Disney World to keep my 10 month old and four year old cool while at the parks. I believe that this is the only fan that is small enough, battery operated and safe enough that you can use with small children. It amazingly kept them cool in 100 degree weather. The manufacturer was right, the fan is built so that little fingers can't get to the blades which is what my 10 month old tried to do. One thing that would make this fan a lot better is if the neck was more flexible. It does bend to allow you to adjust the direction of the air flow but not enough. Another thing that would improve it would be if the head rotated. I might be asking for too much but as a mom, you tend to think of every possible solution that would make life easier for your child and yourself. It's a great price and pretty durable. I would recommend it.
+1	HUGE help for breastfeeding both of my sons. One had a high palate and weak suck and the other had a retracted jaw. Not the best for long term use but a huge help in the beginning. Why there is not a 27mm & a 30mm I will never understand! This is the largest available and seems to do the trick.
+1	You gotta have this in the hospital in case your newborn doesn't latch on right away - it may be due to your nipples not being long enough for the baby to feel it in her mouth. This thing serves the purpose and well!
+1	This little doohicky helped me successfully breast feed my daughter for months until she was big enough and capable enough to latch on, on her own without my help and guidance.  I have large flat nipples that don't stay out much at all, no matter how much I tried to manipulate them too.  Even a hospital grade Medela Symphony pump could only get them to stay out for about a minute after I stopped pumping.  I made sure to keep a handful of these nipple shields around so I could breastfeed my daughter easily all the time.  I even had a case for them (you can google them and find some) and used them when we were out and about. After about 3 months we were able to stop using them because our daughter was big enough and had the know how to latch on by herself.  Don't let anyone discourage you from using these if you need or want to.  I didn't suffer any low supply nor did I get any clogged ducts while using mine.  They can be somewhat hard to come by.  I found mine at a local resale shop (NOT USED! lol!) that was also the local LLL meeting place and they sold all sorts of Medela products and bras and even rented out pumps.  All of the breastfeeding supplies were new in the package.  They even did nursing bra measurements for you there.  It was really nice.  The were a bit stingy on these nipple shields though.  They kept them behind the counter because they didn't really want them to be used.  It's beyond me as to why some hard core breast feeders are so against these when they can really help women breastfeed their children for longer. I was discouraged from using them with my son and regret it because we didn't successfully form and breastfeeding relationship.  After I ignored the 'experts' the second time around with my daughter and used them long term anyway, we successfully breast fed until 9 months and would have gone longer had I not been back to work and pumping.  DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU!!!
+1	I have twin girls, and had hopes of tandem nursing.  As it turned out, both had latching issues and I was so frustrated.  I decided to try these shields, and both girls were able to latch right on immediately.  We have been able to tandem nurse and all!
-1	Only comes with one so don't drop it!! I ordered some from Tommie Tippee (I think that's right) and they come in a pack of 2 and they are much better built.
+1	I purchased the nursing cover in the "Royale" print.  It is very attractive and handy to have when nursing in public.  I keep it in the diaper bag.  Highly recommend.
+1	This is a very nice cover and has been very easy to use.  I like the terry cloth padding provided on the corners of this nursing cover.  It has been very handy when you need something to wipe your babies mouth quickly.
+1	These are adorable and soft enough to keep baby comfortable as well as entertained in the car ... I bought these in the pink bunny option also!
+1	it's very cute and useful - from getting the straps into my baby's chubby neck since he has very sensitive skin!  i was worried it would be too hot for him, but it's not that bad.
+1	Love these! Thank you....It's a universal color. Wish I would have bought these for my daughter when she was an infant. They aren't took bulky, easy to wash (I throw them in a pillow case in the washer) and they're easy to put on and take off. :)
-1	This swaddle is wonderful-- when you purchase it in a size small/medium. However, after ordering the size large after my baby grew I received this swaddle in what was marked as size large. It is definitely not a large. The "large" is actually identical in size to the small/medium. I eventually spoke with the manufacturer about this and I was told that they are having production problems and currently are unable to produce a true size large of this swaddle. So don't order the size "large". This swaddle is wonderful though for a smaller baby (less than 15 pounds)
+1	I think my title explains this product perfectly. My 2 month old has slept 8 hours during the night for the past 3 nights and he's been consistently at 6-7 hours before that. I had a size smaller first and then upgraded to the larger size. He easily sleeps in it in his crib with no issues. Occasionally, he'll pop an arm out, but it's usually b/c I didn't secure the flaps tight enough. GREAT!!!
+1	We had a &#34;colicky&#34; baby, that the doctor's thought was acid reflux but I knew better and after 2 months figured of constant screams of pain, figured out it was a dariy protein intolerance.  Anyhow, swaddling was a lifesaver, but not totally on its own.  We did the &#34;happiest baby on the block&#34; with the 5 S's, swaddle, side, shush, shake/sway, and suck - the combo was the only thing that soothed our baby and at first we only had swaddle blankets and trying to swaddle our first newborn while screaming and crying and fighting us, two exausted parents with headaches, this made it SO simple and convenient.  I ended up with 5 of them since we used them so much - our son spent a lot of time swaddled his first few months of life, and actually until he &#34;told/showed&#34; us he was ready to not be swaddled which was arounf 5 - 5.5 months.
+1	I alternated between this and muslin cloth for swaddling - While this is nice and cosy, there were times when I wanted my son to be more free than what this permits and hence I alternated between this (at night time for long sleep) and swaddling via muslin cloth (during daytime). This definitely helped my son go to sleep immediately.
+1	Bought these for our long car ride as well, since the belt covers that came with the seat weren't that comfy looking and her neck kept tilting over. These are nice, soft and keeps her head up a bit more. Fits snugly under her chin and looks cute. I looked at the neck pillows but i thought it would push her head too far forward. She likes them so it's all good.
-1	The spring in this gate broke after 6 months of use. I am very dissapointed and out a good chunk of money. Of course its too late to return it. I would not reccomend this gate. The open and close latch on it was a total pain as well. Not worth it.
+1	This has the look and feel as the more expensive security blanket brand My Blankee. Its excellent quality, and will surely be a part of our family for years.
+1	Does its duty -- my 10-month old has been grasping at this and sucking his thumb since infancy.  I like the smaller, single-textured blankies, too, but it's kind of cool that this one has two tactile surfaces.  I like its neutral colors.  Very easy to wash, too.
-1	It'd be great if it wasn't so easy to tear off. The Velcro straps that hold toys doesn't do a great job of holding toys either. My ten month old rips this off the rail and rips the toys off the Velcro. Snap buttons might work better.
+1	This product is exactly what was advertised. My daughter started chewing on everything at about 14 months while she was teething. This protects her teeth and crib.
-1	A lot of cribs these days have a thick top rail and have small spaces between the slats on the sides.  Both of these factors make it hard to attach this product.  The way this attaches is with velcro.  There are two velcro strips that you press together between the slats.  On our crib the velcro strips don't even reach that open space because the top of our crib is thick.  Even if they did, I don't think it would be sufficient to hold the thing on because our slats are very close together.  With more and more cribs being convertible into a bed, I'm guessing the thick top rail is pretty common.  And as far as the slats being close together, that is a safety issue, so again probably pretty common.We got some extra velcro make make long straps that would wrap around our top rail, but that didn't work very well and our rail cover is currently laying in a heap in the corner of the babies room.  If I were doing it again, I'd go with one that ties on.  For now, I'm just thankful that the boy doesn't seem to like biting his crib.
+1	So I bought these covers when I noticed our twins were starting to gnaw on the crib railings, thank gosh for prime! They arrived and I washed and dried them and stuck them on. They helped deter and stop the actual damage to the crib. The chewing still happened, we even had some blood on one, but it washed out ok. Now probably 7 months later the Velcro still sticks really good, but my boys peel them on the crib in less than 30 seconds. The are a bit short length wise for our railings, but that never was a problem. I would recommend.
-1	The concept is okay, but it doesn't begin to wrap around the front rail on my crib.  I'm not really sure how the Velcro is supposed to secure to itself through the rails either.  I'm returning it and making my own cover from a used pair of pants and tiring it on with shoe laces.
+1	This is a lot more expensive at the store, is a pure white which the rest are a dirty off white
+1	It's easy to use and works great. I only wish I got it BEFORE my little buy munched on his crib. Oh well. I gave it four stars because I would like a model without the hooks for toys but they don't make it as far as I know. I don't use it to hook toys on it and it looks ugly. More color selection wouldn't hurt either.
+1	I got these because I didn't like the idea of choosing between whether my son would chew on plastic or wood and finish.  And chew he would!Besides the plastic ones weren't compatible with my crib anyway.He did finally figure out how to remove them, but by that time he was pretty much done chewing on it.
+1	A must have (along with the side rails!)  The crib is 100% protected and it was really easy to attach.  Most importantly my son is 100% protected (no more paint flecks on his face) and 100% happy (because he can chomp on his crib to his heart's content).  Really easy to maintain, I machine wash (regular cycle) and hang dry mine and they have already survived 3 rounds of washing in the first month.
-1	Before buying make sure the length is long enough for your rail. I have  a sleigh bed crib and this does not fit the rail. It's not long enough to reach the velcro on both sides. It fits older style cribs but not sleigh types.  Will add customer pic to product for example
+1	I really liked this product at first and would have given it five stars then.  I like that it attaches by velcro so that it doesn't damage the crib rail and it has little tabs when I can attach toys.  I also appreciated that it is washable since my baby drools all over it!  However, my son is now able to pull it off when he is standing.  When I come into his room, sometimes half of the cover is hanging off of the crib.  I wonder if it might be better designed if there was more velcro to make it stay on a bit more, but overall I am happy with this product.
+1	It works well for our Sorelle Rosa crib which has relatively thin bars and hidden hardware.  The covers are a couple inches short for the length of the crib but this works well since cribs with hidden hardware also have bars flush against both ends of the length that would have made it hard to pinch off the last bits of velcro.  Note that the velcro attachment extends the full length of the teether cover.Also worth noting is that the material can be bunched up for the attachment of a cozy crib tent.  This takes out the extra length provided in the attachment strips of the tent while giving a bit more volume to teether cover.  It looks seamless to the casual observer.We're still waiting for the baby but the product looks quite durable and the initial wash didn't cause any pilling.
+1	Love the bib !!!! i washed it several times and still looks like new . i bought 2 of them
+1	This bib is super cute, and washes nice, but I really did notlike the velcro fastener.  My baby got a cut and a scratchedbeck of the neck from this velcro.  It is sharp and I was nothappy about that.  Make sure you secure the velcro overlappingit to prevent scratching.  I am not liking velcro bibs anymore.
+1	My daughter loves this bib.  It is of adequate size to prevent food from getting onto her shoulders when she turns her head from side to side during a feeding.  She also really likes the teether.  I've had two of these for several months now, they are constantly in the washer and so far, have held up really well.  Only thing is, the packaging says nothing about BPA free plastic on the teether part.  However, when I purchased mine, the sight claimed they were BPA free.  I haven't let it bother me too much because she chews on most of her toys and only a few of them claim to be made of BPA free plastic.  Give these a try if your child has trouble hanging on to her teether.  This one is guaranteed never to hit the floor because its fastened to the bib itself.
+1	Very large bib, soft but thick, and the corner is fun for the baby.  It's our favorite, and we wish we had more like it!  Nothing gets through it - very thick cotton - like a nice towel.
+1	We have double hung windows in our basement and this is the only product that I found worked for them. I also like that they're removable and I didn't have to use screws or nails to install them!The windows are probably still able to be opened but it would definitely take a strong person from the outside!They definitely detur someone from breaking in (which is why I purchased them)I think they are most definitely suitable for child safety purposes!
+1	Better than most of the crap child-proofing products out there that I've bought. Makes me feel better about the low windows in my 4-year-old's room.
+1	We were very happy to be able to install these easily in our windows, which are fairly new.  My 2.5yo toddler cannot remove them and then open the windows.  When he is not home, I do take them off certain windows if I want to open them all the way (or more than 4 inches, which is where we set them for our own peace of mind.)  We are using these in a 2nd floor for safety, not so much security.  I like that they can be removed quickly in the event of an emergency. We consider these a safe alternative to window guards that look like gates across all your windows.
+1	If your child is tall enough to reach them, it doesn't take much force to pry them from the Velcro, and totally defeat the system.  However, I got around this by tilting the lower window (of a double-hung) in, and applying the wedge to the outside.  Since I don't think our child knows how to tilt in the window, nor is strong enough to pull the catches, this solution should work.  You just need to be careful.  Defiantly not a useful option for any child over 5 or 6.  You'd probably need something requiring a key at that point.  (and of course, you'd need a key accessible in the event of an emergency)
+1	I have a number of different sized windows (sash, new plastic type windows) in my baby's room and I installed these on each window - two on the wider/larger window. Easy to install and works well. Even when I open a window and forget they are on the window, they stop me opening the window too far.Just follow the instructions, to make sure the wedge is secure. Can be easily repositioned.
-1	I should have known it wasn't going to work when I opened the package and it had velcro as the main fastening method. I followed the instructions and put both wedges put on my double pane window. If you are a 3 year old, you probably won't be able to force it open but with any little bit of strength and shove, it comes right off the velcro. I wish I could return it but I threw away all the packaging. Maybe I can use it for my little girl's playhouse to keep its window secure. I just went to Home Depot and bought one of those hand screw metal locks for $2 and it's 100% better than this crap.
+1	The colors may not be to everyone's palate if you want a play pen that would match your home decor as it is garish; but if you don't care about color schemes, I would definitely recommend this product. It is a great product, very sturdy, is light and folds easily. It's worth every cent I paid for it. My six month old sons rolls around in it, and I feel very confident leaving him there to play while I attend to my daily chores.
+1	My dad bought this and one other (Safety 1st Prelude Sport Playard, Citrusplayard for us before our twin girls arrived.  I picked the Dream On Me because I wanted one that was bigger that both my girls would fit in for more than a year.  This one is definitely bigger than a Graco!  My girls are now 18 months old, 31in tall, and 22lbs each and still fit great.  (I know the weight max is supposed to be 35lbs, but I see no drooping or wear with 44lbs in it) It IS a little difficult to set up and take down at first, but once you figure it out (and remember!) it is VERY EASY.TO SET UP:DO NOT PUT THE BOTTOM ALL THE WAY DOWN FIRST!  The bottom must be pulled up in order to lock the bars! I always leave it just over halfway pulled up, then lock the longer bars first, then the shorter bars  THEN PUT THE BOTTOM DOWN.  The locking mechanism is double jointed so be sure you lock both joints in.  If you do not leave the bottom up far enough it will allow you to lock all but one bar into place.  That is why I say to leave it just over halfway up and you will not have problems.TO TAKE DOWN:FIRST PULL THE BOTTOM UP! Again, I go over halfway up with it. I then unlock the shorter bars, then the longer.  Again make sure you unlock both of the joints, or it will not fold up properly.  My only issue with this playard is that because it is larger, the pad is larger and it has to fold over on itself once when you wrap it around to fold it up.  It can be a little difficult to do alone, but I usually just put it on the floor and squeeze it together.I read all the one star reviews on this wondering why on earth anyone would give it one star and almost all of them said they couldn't get it set up.  I didn't mess with it for about 5 months (it stayed set up) and I did forget how to set it up/take it down and started to get really frustrated.  Once I figured it out it was a cinch!My girls got sick and vomited in it and it was easy to clean.  The pad was very easy to clean and it did not soak up one bit of the cleaning solution I used on it.  We've been using it almost every day for a year and a half and it still looks like the day we bought it.If you're looking for a larger than average, no frills playard at a great price, this is it!
+1	This bed  has served as my son's regular sleep space away from home for months now (from 20-30mos so far). It's much more roomy than most travel cribs. The down side to that is it's tricky finding proper sheets. We simply went with regular crib sheets.I used a crib-sized mattress pad to add a little extra cushion and support, but I didn't go out of my way to find an extra travel mattress that would fit. I hadn't seen any good recs for one anyway.Overall, this is great value for the money and will likely provide a regularly sleeping space for my son until he's 3 or so.
+1	This is a great little playpen, easy to open, very very easy to store--it comes folded and contained in it's storage form.  It was such a great surprise to get something "whole" and ready to use.I will be baby sitting my new granddaughter and needed a bed-like place for her to be safe and comfortable.  This was a great choice and a good buy.
+1	I got this playpen in the multi, because at the time it was the cheapest, and I really didn't care. Now, it is a little garish, but at the same time I actually really like it-it's bright, sturdy, and is about  1 1/2 in. taller and 3 in. longer than my Graco pack and play. I like how the ends are solid, sometimes my 11 month old isn't exactly crazy about being in the playpen, but if she sees me walk away, it gets worse. The solid ends allow me to sit in the same room, but out of sight, which lets my daughter play by herself longer. I gave it 5 stars, because I have yet to find any flaws with it. Granted, it isn't as elegant? as my pack and play, but as already stated, that wasn't important to me. So far, it is sturdy, sets up quickly and easily, and I like that it comes with a storage bag, which as yet I haven't tried, but since that is what it came in, I know that it fits. The pocket on one end is a good place to store the bag. I have been very satisfied with this purchase, and I would buy it again. Oh, and the picture shows it having the ends taller and curved, but they aren't, all 4 sides are the same height.Update:I have used the storage bag twice, and it is very easy to get in the bag, and the handles make it easy to carry-I'm liking it better than my Pack and Play!
+1	We wanted a play pen to serve as a bed for my one-year-old grandson when he stays overnight. I looked at a used one from a neighbor that was quite questionable. For just $15 more, I found this amazing one that is even a big longer so that it will be more comfortable. So glad we got this! It's easy to put up and take down! I like that the ends are NOT see-through because keeping light out is important for my little guy to sleep soundly. :)
-1	Mom's and Dad's do not buy this pack and play. I opened the package excited to set this up and right away I noticed how cheap it was. Then the worst part the middle brack was longer than the ones on either side of it... so the pack and play was not level and rocked. Sooooo unsafe. I called the company and they told me to call Amazon and return it. I'm so mad about this. The worst part was trying to put it back in the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!
+1	I have 3 kids under 4.  They do not have stranger danger yet.  So if I'm changing a diaper, making lunch or something else that needs my immediate attention & some one comes to the door I need to make sure the older two do not open the door.  These are perfect!!!!  They can not open the door if some one rings the bell & it gives added security if some one tries to break in.  If someone wanted to get in there is no way they could kick the door in, they would have to break a window.  This also doesn't put any holes in the door & is hardly noticeable.  It's the best investment I've ever made!!
+1	Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It's basically like a really high deadbolt.
+1	My barely 2 year old figured out how to open this on his first try. However, we keep it way up at the top of the door so he can't reach it. It's very quick and easy to open, and my toddler can no longer open the door for strangers.
+1	Perfect lock.Much better than those door chains, and looks better too.I test it on my garage back door.  I only used one there, and I could not break open the door even if my life depended on it, and I'm 5'9&#34; 220 pounds pretty fit.I put 2 on my front door and now have a great piece of mind knowing that probably only a car driving through my front door will break it open.I recommend this lock to all my friends and family.Also looks great with any of the finishes it comes with.
+1	Installed these on all exterior doors, kids have real trouble opening them even trying to escape using a chair. Very important with a pool in the backyard with small kids, very small price to pay for this kind of secure safety. Just get in the habit of locking it every time, no matter what and it will do the trick.
+1	The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google "Door Guardian installation instructions", find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8" inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16" inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16" inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.
+1	Easy to install, looks great and no one can tell it's a child proofing device.Note: This product works like a deadbolt. You can only lock/unlock it from the inside. So it will not automatically latch when you close the door, or if you go out someone has to lock it again from the inside.
+1	This has been a godsend for us. We've been worried about our toddler opening up the front door. Once we installed this, it's been no worries. It was super easy to install and easy to figure out how to work.
+1	Our house has french-style handles on all doors.  Thanks to my crafty and determined 2-year-old, I have found there are few choices for french doors that fit properly and can withstand repeated attempts to best them. The one that worked for internal doors (typical plastic snap-on type) wouldn't fit on the front door due to the deadbolt and the adhesive wouldn't stick to the metal exterior doors. I naively relied upon the deadbolt until finding her outside one day. When did she learn how to open the deadbolt!?  As I don't expect to need it more than a few years I didn't want something that would put holes in the molding that we'd need to deal with later. Finally found this and it is simple but brilliant! I agree with other reviewers: mount it high enough; as it's not unattractive like most others is easy to forget about it and wonder why the door won't open :-) ; so far seems strong enough to handle all she can dish out.One thing that I wish I would have known is that it can (or maybe should) be mounted on the side (left or right) of the door with the knob. My assumption was that it went on the side with the hinges where the door attaches to the frame.  My hubby & his dad mounted ours on the other side (with the knob) and it works just fine.  Granted, I didn't read the instructions, and am not sure if they did either before just pulling out the power tools, so not sure what they say is proper. Also, although one reviewer mentioned, I forgot that it must be mounted on the side(front vs. back) that's the "pull" side of the door (the side with the round part of the hinge exposed).
+1	We picked up these flip locks for our front and rear door to prevent our toddlers from sneaking outside without supervision.  It's good way to install without permanently marring your door or trim.  The lock is easy to engage and disengage, and is strong enough to prevent 2 yr old egresses.On the down side, a forgetful adult may be able to break the lock, since it is not as beefy as a dead bolt.  This is strictly a preventer for children and not a security lock to prevent intruders.  For a child lock, it works well.4 stars only due to the finish - the painting coating will scratch/rub from the door running against it, and may require touchup.
+1	I have 5 of these all over my house and have used them for over a year. They are incredibly easy to install. Only 2 screws are needed. The white color blends into the door trim and is minimally noticeable. They also couldn't be easier to use.Note: The included screws are horrible because they are soft and strip very easily. You will want to drill a pilot hole so less pressure is put on the screwhead. If the screw starts stripping, remove it immediately so it doesn't become a permanent fixture of your door frame. Use a drywall or wood screw instead - available at any big box home store.
+1	This lock is working well for me to keep my child from accidentally opening a basement door. There are some things to keep in mind, though.One, put this high. I just found out today that my two-year-old knows how to open it. I was holding him near the door to see if he could figure it out and he did. It's very easy to unlock this clasp, as you just have to push the plate slightly up while pulling it towards you. If a child can use a chair or something else to reach it, they could beat it. There's nothing he can move in my house that will let him even get close to reaching mine, though.Two, the screws that come with the product are junk, as has been stated. Even with little torque, mine both were eaten by the drill bit. I put two of my own in without a problem, though. Remember to keep the tiny little screw, though, if you ever want to permanently unlock the product. Me, I'll just remove it when it no longer serves a function, but it's good to have the option in case you need to leave it in place but don't want to bother with it all the time.Three, make your install easy. Close the door you're putting it on, hold it in place in the locked position, then open your door, put the lock up and screw it in. You'll want to actually see it in place before attaching it because if the plate can't lock into position, you'll have to take it down and screw it in all over again.So far, I'm glad I've gotten this rather than the plastic "globes" you put over doorknobs. When I first put this on, I forgot about it and tried opening the door and it stopped me. At that point, just to see, I tried opening it with more pressure and it held. Looks like it'll stop my kid even if he really tries to open the door.UPDATE April 12, 2012:I'm buying a second one tonight for my front door. This has worked out well for these past few months and kept the little one from being able to open the door to the basement, but he's now able to open the front door, so one is going there as well.
+1	I got this when my almost 3-year old decided how much fun it was to go into our garage and out our front door. I decided I had to do something when we were in our backyard playing and I discovered he had gone back through the house and out the front door! My husband is not mechanically inclined and had no problems installing this. It works great!
+1	This is one of the most beautiful toys my son has. I love the rainbow of colors. The clackety-clack of the outer segments, the colors, and the changing shape of the globe keeps him interested. He'll still look at it now that he's 15 months old. It's also very durable--it shows no signs of wear still.
+1	This toy is so much fun to play with for my toddler.  Even I find myself doodling with it occasionally.
+1	This toy instantly became my five-month old's favorite.  We also have the Baby Einstein Bendy Ball and he far prefers this one.  It's a partially complete orb with plastic "slices" that move around the outside.  They slide easily and make a nice clacking noise that my baby likes.  Each "slice" is a bright color and the outside is textured, while the inside is reflective.  The little character in the middle spins easily.
+1	My daughter is amazed with this ball and loves it...it is probably her favorite toy that she got for Christmas!!!
+1	I bought this for our 6 yr. old when she was an infant and loved it and repurchased now for our 6 mo. old. This was one of our favorites and had to make sure my 6 mo. old had the same toy. So glad they still make the toy, and it's exactly the same, well built and very entertaining for her. It's a toy I used for motivating both my kids to start crawling.
+1	I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while
+1	Little hands love shaking it.  As it rolls they can see the face and chase.  Would buy as gift for others.
+1	My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.
+1	My baby plays with this toy often. He is attracted to the mirrors inside the ball and the happy face. It's a great toy to develop his hand eye coordination. There are many ways for him to hold it, and use his hands to spin the happy face inside. Negative reviews complain the ball doesn't spin or roll. It is the middle piece that spins, and you can roll the ball if you throw it hard enough, or it will roll a little bit with normal play. I liked that it didn't roll too far when my son was younger, because he wasn't able to crawl after a ball, but had fun with toys that moved around a bit.
+1	This toy is very nice with great colors, textures and a nice clicking noise. Good for little one's who can crawl after it.
-1	I thought it would give you ideas of how to paint or what to paint but it is just the paint itself and a sponge, which is a little overpriced for what it is. Great concept and it turned out really well, just wonder if i could have bought some non toxic paint at the local store for 10% of the cost.
+1	Lots of paint to use several times. Advise: if you have more than one &#34;artists&#34; working on you buy extra paint brushes/sponges!
+1	We purchased this for our 9 month old daughter and she LOVES this chair.  We've been able to use this in almost every restaurant we've been in. This won't work on thin metal tables or tables with a limited ledge.  The top metal piece that sits on top of the table has a cushion on it so it won't damage tabletops.  I keep this in the car all the time and I can easily store this in the basket of our stroller when we're in NYC or D.C. It's very lightweight and has a great harness (not just a seatbelt) to keep my daughter safe. My daughter enjoys that she can sit next to us during meals instead of watching us from her stroller.
-1	my baby is around the 25th percentile in size for a 6-month old, and the harness on this chair was ridiculously loose even when fully tightened around her. that is my primary reason for returning this. the secondary reason is because the design is very poor:- the seat cover is permanently fixed to the frame which makes it a challenge to clean- the seat has minimal padding and the back is low. the inglesina version is padded and the seat back is taller.- the parts of the frame that come into contact with the top and underside of a table seem poorly thought out compared to Inglesina's version. the inglesina fast table chair has much larger grips that hold the chair to a table. it is overall heavier but i feel like it has a much more secure grip than the Metoo.
+1	Loved using this. Great for using in booths at restaurants, packing in your suitcase for trips, very happy with this item. Best $50 you can spend with a child.
+1	I'm going to start out by saying I have three kids. A 4 year old, 2.5 year old and 9 month old. They have 9 cousins and between the 12 of them we have purchased just about every baby/child toy product. I have a boon highchair that I love, but I needed something to use for my baby when she is being watched for me at someone elses home. She was just sitting on the floor making a giant mess with her food. I looked at all of the reviewes and decided this would be the best for the price. It came very fast (like always with Amazon) and was very easy to attach to the table. I seriously think a monkey could have done it. I was worried I didn't do it right because it was too simple. After I was satisfied it was on tight I put my niece in it to test it out (my kid wasn't going in it!). She survived the experement and loved it. She was just haning out in air eating her food, all containted not taking up much space. If you live in a small appartment or dont like to collect baby 'junk' this is the chair for you. I haven't had to clean it yet but its a baby chair, its going to get dirty, the fabric seems easy to clean. Also someome in another review mentioned that it wasn't supportive and there was a bar at the back. I'm not one to bubble wrap my kids in miles of foam covered cloth (hence the boon highchair) but I think if your kid cant sit up properly it probably shouldn't be in this chair. I'm happy with the purchase and I know this is going to be shared with all the kids and used regurly. I'm very happy with my purchase!
+1	We bought this for a trip to Florida.  It was very handy as we didn't want to be holding my baby to feed him every time while staying at a vacation rental that didnt provide high chair.  We now even use it for restaurants that have high chair because he he feels left out in those and can also stand up and climb outs.  This product gets him close to the table and he can't climb out of it.  And the light weight of this product is the other big plus, we can bring it everywhere!  We used it when we were on a house boat too, it's a must have.
+1	Are you ever at a party, and wish that you could see adults fumble with a baby gate and look foolish?  Its always hilarious!  Then buy this right now, dont even think about it.  Don't go look in your bank account to see if you have the correct funds, just stack it on top of your growing credit card bill and GET THIS GATE; I cant recommend it enough. Seriously it keeps nonsense OUT: place all unwanted things in your life on one side, you get on the other.  Oooohhhmmmmmm (yoga bear) life is good.  put out the incense! thats so 90s
+1	Great gate! We bought three gates in all, and this was one of the easiest to install. You don't have to screw it into the wall if you don't want. It's just by tension. It's been up for about two months, and it's held up great.
+1	We got this gate for the bottom of our stairs and it is perfect! It is sturdy and was easy to install. We also got the Y-shaped gate adaptors because we have a banister on one side with small spindles. We have a 43 1/2" opening so I bought the gate and two 7" extensions and it fits perfectly!Over a year later, this gate is still working great to keep my toddler off the stairs.
+1	I have regalo gate and this gate at home. Regalo needs two hands most of the time. This gate is truly single handed. Swings both ways. The opening is bigger than Regalo. Off the two gates I have, I love dreambaby.
+1	I like the dreambaby gate. it is sturdy and the bars are too small for my (not so slim) cat to fit through. It is also thin enough so that she cant jump onto of the gate to get into the baby room.unfortunately, the main gate does not come with a gate hook to leave the gate open when needed. Also, the gate and extensions were a bit difficult to fit together as one of the gates was not properly quality checked and the screw holes were too small and the wrong height. We had a lot of difficulty trying to force the gate to fit together. But once the gate was set up, its good.
+1	Beautiful, so soft, baby loves tummy time on his lamby.  Haven't washed it yet, but spot clean every time he spits up on it, which is very often.
-1	When I bought this for my baby I already knew about New Zealand's efforts to reduce SIDS and the link between SIDS and mattress off-gassing, but I did NOT know that a significant number of the New Zealand "Cot Death" study deaths OCCURED ON SHEEPSKIN!  Apparently, putting infants to sleep on sheepskin has long been a common practice in New Zealand, which also had a very high rate of SIDS (triggering the research which uncovered the off-gassing connection)!  From what I can tell, it seems that regardless of how sheepskin is processed, it contains phosphorous (risking creation of phosphine nerve gasses in crib environment).  The other risk factors are frequent presence of arsenic and antimony in sheepskins, though I don't know if processing methods can increase or reduce that.  Bottom line:  while the research overall regarding sheepskins specifically and SIDS is conflicted, in my opinion there is no need to take this risk with your precious baby!  I especially want to warn others against making the mistake that I did, which was to assume that this product would be safe because it is not synthetic.  So, if you are considering buying this for baby, do some research first.  Personally, I deeply regret that I put this on top of my baby's organic crib mattress!  It is now removed, and I will give it to much older members of the household who have coveted it (and do not have sensitive, still-developing nervous systems).  By the way, I do not mean to imply that parents should not also be concerned about mattress off-gassing, which is also a clear high risk to be aware of.  ** Finally, I want to clarify that I gave this product one star because it is marketed for babies, which I believe is highly irresponsible.  As a lambskin for any other use it is quite nice.
+1	We bought this as a play mat for our new baby... but her big sister loved it so much that she &#34;borrowed&#34; it before her sister was born and has not slept without it since (almost 6 months ago).  Highly recommend and will probably buy another.
+1	I used this product while pregnant because I had to sleep on my side for extended periods. Without it I was so sore, my skin hurt, this made all the difference. Then when baby was born it went into his cosleeper and has been ever since, though we sometimes removed it temporarily so he could have it elsewhere. He loves it, sleeps on it always, and loves to try to eat it now that he's in that phase. I was afraid to wash it for a long while, especially since a lot of the wool washes contained questionable ingredients that I didn't want against my baby's skin and in his lungs! I finally found the Imse Vimse wool wash and it works beautifully. It's like new. Maybe better! I washed it on gentle, allowed it to spin then air dried and it's amazing gorgeous, no combing or other work required. Regular detergent in the US not recommended due to alkalinity.Lovely product. I would buy one for everyone having a baby, really.
+1	We bought this for our newborn to practice tummy time.  Also bought it for my new nephew 2 months older than ours. Good reports so far and our newborn seems to like it.  Hates tummy time but it has nothing to do with the sheepskin.Remember to frequently shake out/beat the rug to manage the dust and hair that accumulates surprisingly quickly.
+1	In regard to what some have posted about toxins in sheepskins--this Bowron product is safe. See below.From: [...]"G L Bowron & Co uses a combination synthetic tannage process for all its shortwool (SWW) and longwool (LWW) Sheepskin production, including Babycare products.The tanning process for Babycare products includes the use of Chromium III, which is a non toxic and non carcinogenic chemical.All Bowron Sheepskins are free of chemicals specified in the Oko-tex Standard 100, which include:(1) Pesticides (PCP/TeCP) (Pentachlorophenols, Tetrachlorophenols)(2) Organic Tin compounds(3) Azo Dyestuffs(4) Extractable Heavy Metals (Chrome VI, Antimony, Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium,  Cobalt, Copper, Nickel, Mercury)Although the wool on Bowron Sheepskins is bleached during processing, it is done so with hydrogen peroxide--no chlorinated chemicals are used at any stage of the tanning process."From [...]"Proven and loved by millions of babies around the world.In the crib or playpen, or on-the-go in stroller or car.Clinically tested in hospital and laboratory research to betotally safe and secure to calm and comfort your baby."This is considered one of the safest baby sheepskins in the world, which is why it is so popular. The natural color is a tell-tale sign. Stay away from snow white sheepskins--this means that they have been bleached and excessively treated.
+1	So soft and my baby loves being on. I haven't found she sleeps any longer on it but its a great play time mat for tummy time etc...
+1	These blocks are perfect for us!  They are cloth and machine washable (hold up pretty good) and my son loves them.  He chews on the tags and likes the various noises they make.  A bit pricey, but great blocks that I hope will continue to be entertaining for a very long time.
+1	I bought these for my 6 month old son who loves chewing on the tags of his bibs. I also liked that these were soft and he could wave them around erratically or throw them without hurting himself or anyone around him.The blocks arrived a day after I ordered them and I couldn't be happier and immediately washed as directed. One block made crinkly noises while another had a rattle in it. The animals are cute and vary in texture. As new, they stacked and the corners were perfect. After the wash, they didn't stack as well and one corner of every block was folded inward. This minor problem didn't keep my son from enjoying the blocks or keep them from rolling around when tossed but its a minor aesthetic nuisance. We could pull the corners back out from time to time, but they would just fold right back in. I have had no other issues with this toy and would recommend it to anybody whose kid loves tags.***UPDATE: 7/28/11***After multiple washings, the blocks are now just lumpy pancakes. They definitely do not stack anymore but the animals, tags, crinkly noise maker, rattles are all still intact and vibrant. My son still likes them but only to chew on.
+1	My 9 month old loves tags and strings that stick out from anything.  So I thought these taggies blocks would be great for him.  The blocks are colorful and each block has different tags and strings and crinkles and jingles.  Absolutely adorable!  You can hang them in your stroller to keep them busy.
+1	Thes are so neat and very light so babies can play with them very easily.  My son loves these blocks.  They are also very unique with different colors and textures.  Great for babies development.  Happy with my purchase and would recommend to any parent.
-1	I bought these Taggies soft blocks thinking that they were going to be "soft" blocks that would at least hold the shape of a "block".  They do not hold there shape AT ALL!  They squish down into whatever shape... and then never "Pop" back (even if you try to re-shape them).  I would not recommend these blocks.  We bought them for our son because he loves this one "Sassy" foam block that he has.  These blocks did not even entice him.  He does play with them ocassionally because they have fun things sewn onto them, but he is mostly not interested...
+1	When I opened the box to find these Taggies soft blocks I was ecstatic. AppleBlossom likes them too. There are so many colors and textures! I love the different animals and the shooting star! Two blocks have a bell inside and the other two blocks have the crinkly material, both are great noises that really catches her attention and curiosity. Already she is grasping the tags and rubbing them between her fingers. These blocks are the first Taggies-type product she's been around and already I can tell they are a big hit. When she is more into holding the blocks I can easily see toting a couple around in the diaper bag, and they are no problem at all in size for that either.
-1	These blocks are super cute, but are not stuffed at all, so the minute your baby squeezes them or sits on them or anything like that, they just flatten out. They are not fun to play with at all because of this.
+1	These are hollow blocks, so they will get squished/crushed very easily.  You can pull them back to their original square shape, but they aren't really blocks in my opinion.  They are squishy cubes.  That being said, I still think they are a good purchase (again, so long as you aren't under the impression that you can stack these blocks).  They are very colorful, with many different animals, patterns, textures, and lots of tags for your baby to explore.
+1	My seven month old grandson loves this toy. It is soft and colorful. His little hands can grasp it easily and he loves the rattle effect. Highly recommend.
+1	My 9 month old son loves it for the car rides because of the tags and the chime sound it makes when you shake it.  Definitely worth the price, especially as it helps soothes the little one to sleep for car rides.  Another good Taggie product.
+1	The tabbie textures and the noises, one if her favorite toys!  I lost her first one and bought this to replace. Well worth the money for the smiles she gets from this!
+1	This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.
+1	I bought this for my daughter when she was an infant. She loved that it jingled, liked the colors, could chew on the tags and nose, and liked the vibration of the toy in the middle.  Overall a good product for an infant.
-1	This Taggies toy is not much fun for baby at all! It's too difficult for even a year old baby too pull out the pink vibrating piece and when you pull it out for baby the cord is so short it literally moves for 3 seconds max! Lastly it does not hold it's shape and flattens out over time even with barely any play time on it. For the price there are MUCH better toys out there!
+1	Quality made product. We only used this for two weeks to give our son a sponge bath after he was born.
+1	I have been using this sponge with Ikea's baby bath tub for the past 2 months since we brought our daughter home from the hospital. It has turned out to be a perfect choice. I got an expensive plastic baby bather as a shower gift but it never left the box.My baby complained only the first time she took a bath. Since then she loves it and even when she is fussy stops crying the moment I put her into the water.I was able to give her a bath even when the belly button stump was still there-it didn't get wet.I recommend using a squirt bottle to spray the baby with. I've been using the one I was given in the hospital. Also foaming shampoo is better than the regular one because you will always use less of it, and ultimately baby's skin won't get irritated. I have been using the Mustela newborn-even though it is a little expensive.Finally-you cannot beat the price!I highly recommend this product
+1	Like most first time new moms, i went out and spent $40+ on a fancy baby tub, that my baby only fit in for a few months.  He loves the sponge because more of his body gets wet. For the price, it seems to be holding up very well also!  If it does tear, I will just order a new one!
+1	Certain things you just want to write a review for. Of the many baby items I have purchased, this is one of them. For me, this sponge makes bath time a lot easier to deal with. It's more about giving the newborn a softer surface to rest on so that they don't hurt their still fragile head. The baby outgrows this sponge by around month 5-6. By that time, you should no longer need this anyways. Any rate, a top notch product for a very nice price.
+1	I used this in our infant tub as an insert to hold our little man in place for the first 3 months.  It made bath time much easier as I didnt' have to be holding him with one hand the entire time.  It is a sponge so it stays warm.  I would definetly get this for newborns!
+1	The packaging of this item came in perfect shape (could have been used as a gift).  The bath sponge itself is very high quality.  It fits in the foldable infant bath we had and dries completely after each bath.  I was going to get the 2-pack, but I'm glad I didn't, I think this one will last.
+1	We purchased an expensive and highly rated "newborn to toddler" bathtub when our first daughter was born.  What a joke! I gave it away after two baths and we ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub instead. Older and wiser, we purchased this EXTREMELY CHEAP sponge when our second daughter was born. It keeps her fairly submerged, supported, and warm, and makes baths easy as pie (and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did).  Sure, it may wear out sooner than later, but who cares?  At this price, we can afford to go through a couple of them.
+1	Very sturdy and thick, far superior to the Munchkin brand I got at Target.  Great for first sponge baths on the counter, then laying down in the big bath, now my son sits on it in the bath (8 mo).  Quality is excellent and so is the price.
+1	This is a good bath sponge. It fits in our square kitchen sink and makes it much more comfortable (seemingly) for infant bathing. Also saves me from having to support the baby's head and neck for the entire bath. Easy to wring out and dries quickly. I do wish it came with a storage bag to help keep it clean when not in use.
+1	My baby is four weeks old and bathtime was not much fun for either one of us until we got this great little inexpensive sponge.  We have an infant tub with the sling, but he would get so cold and slide down so I was constantly having to hold his head up and readjust him.  Also I had to put his tub in our big bathtub, so I was forced to lean over the side.  Not fun when you've had a C-section!  I had seen tubs that fit in the kitchen sink but I really wanted a way to bathe him in our smaller bathroom sink, where I have all of his towels and bath items nearby.  This sponge suits our needs perfectly.  It soaks up the warm water so my son stays warm, and it supports his head wonderfully.  Bath time is so much quicker and easier now, and there is a lot less crying!  I will probably use this product until he can sit up on his own.  Even if he outgrows the bathroom sink, I will probably put this sponge in his infant tub for extra comfort and support.  Definitely worth the money for me!
+1	This spounge is an amazing value for the price.  It is hearty and holds up wash after wash, it is also soft and cushy and perfect for baby or toddler to lean back on.  A must have!
+1	with my first born we used one of those baby baths, I hated it uncomfortable it was hard to keep him warm i love this product, so much easier to use and just wring it our when yo are done.
+1	I bought this when we had our first child instead of buying a bath bathtub.  This is much cheaper, and much more efficient.  Also, this stores much more easily.
-1	it was comfy for my son-- but it's bulky and impossible to dry after baths.  so the mold came -- despite my efforts to squeeze and hang it -- in just over a week.  4 or 5 baths and mold was growing inside and out.  disgusting and dangerous!!!
+1	I had one of these with my two year old daughter when she was an infant, and just bought a new one for the baby I'm pregnant with. I  LOVE this thing. They are great to use in the sink or bathtub. They're so much better than hard plastic baby tubs.The only thing is that you have to ring them it out well to prevent mildew from forming, and find a place to hang it up.This thing is so affordable too. Best baby item, must have for me.
+1	I use this with my now 9 week old daughter and really like it. I was able to fit it in my kitchen sink and use it easily, before the cord fell off for sponge baths, because you let it absorb the water and they lay on it. We were given a baby bath and I tried using that a few times but I have to say, all I need is this sponge. She is so comfortable on it, unlike the other baby bathtub, with a sling insert. This is easy to use, makes her the most happy during bath time, and is easy to dry. For now its all we need.
+1	I had something similar to this sponge 18 years ago.  My old one was a bit longer which was nice.  It doesn't seem to hold water in it as well either.  I do think it is better than the hard plastic bathtubs but it could still use some improvements.
+1	After spending tons of money on high end bath tubs ( 3 of them) which did not work all that great, we bought this one as recommended by a friend. Worth the price and we love it. We use in the Kitchen sink.I wish I hadn't spend all that money on other stuff we never used.
-1	Loved it at first, then saw black spots starting on it (probably because its hard to squeeze dry after use, so it stays slightly damp - perfect for mould).Binned it immediately, not safe for baby. Oh, and at least I only paid $6 at Target, I would be well annoyed to have bought it on here for far more.
+1	I bought this to use as a travel bath for my baby on quick trips. It is basically a thick large sponge that a newborn can lay on and an infant can sit on to bathe in a sink, tub, shower stall or on a countertop.Pour a cup of warm water on the sponge before placing your child on it. Also be sure to wring it out very well and allow to air dry after every use.This is an excellent alternative to an infant bath while travelling and is very portable. You could also place in an infant tub for extra cushioning.
-1	Great idea, it is a must have for newborns and especialy  for new moms who are nerveous with the first baths- as I was. I had this sponge and the frog shaped green sponge ( don't remember who's the manufator). Although this one is bigger - and that's an advantage, it got black disoloration (nothing spilled on it and it is not mold) after only a few times we used it. It didn't come off  in the wash and although it didn't smell or anything I didn't want to use something that looked "dirty" for my daughter's baths. It did not happen to the green sponge, which I would reccomend.
+1	My pediatrician even recommended this sponge and that I buy several of them since they get gross after awhile, my baby seems to be the most comfortable, and it fits perfect in our sink!
+1	This sponge works great for travel. I used it over the holidays instead of lugging the infant tub around. It is a bit hard to wring out, that could be improved.
+1	leaves you with both hands free for bathing a little one.  DO NOT USE if you baby can roll over as the sides are not high enough to keep the baby in place.  The sponge will sort of float so don't put too much water in the tub.  I have washed this in a front load washing machine but low the &#34;spin&#34; speed.
+1	We used this to make bathtime easier on us when we transitioned my son to the big tub from the infant bath. When he's laying down it's SO much easier to shampoo his hair without getting soap in his eyes and to clean his bottom. Definitely not a product that lasts forever. I would plan on buying a new one every month or two for sanitary reasons but we were able to get it almost 100% dry just by squeezing it out and it air dried the rest of the way. This sponge is bigger than other bath sponges on the market too.
+1	Perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for!  I put my little Grandson on this in my kitchen sink for a bath and he was comfortable and happy; no slipping around.  When he was smaller he leaned back on it and splashed a little and enjoyed the water.  Now he's a little older (7 months) so he sits up on it and plays with toys.  It's perfect; so easier than a slippery tub/sink, and so much easier that trying to sit on a towel, etc.  I also lay it down dry on my kitchen counter, or anyplace, covered with a towel, and use it for a changing table.
+1	Such a simple product, but works best!  I love it so much better than the plastic tubs.  Just lay in the tub with shallow warm water, bathe baby, wring it out, store. Done!  And takes up hardly any space at all.  Great product, so glad my sister recommended it to me. I've been using it since my babe was a newborn.
+1	I'm so glad we bought this, my daughter hated her baby bath tub, but she was too small for the big tub, this worked perfectly. Don't waste your money on more expensive products, this works great and you wont use it for too long anyway.
+1	It's a large sponge. It doesn't have added features that aren't readily visible. But, it does work well if you don't want a giant plastic baby bath tub.I lived in a small townhome when I had my child -- I didn't have space to store a large plastic tub. This worked well for sponge baths before the umbilical cord stump fell off and to pad the bottom of the kitchen sink when my child was small enough to bathe in the sink.Ironically, I moved when my child was 5 months old and ended up getting a large, plastic tub. It was nice to not worry about my child squirming out of my grip and hitting her head against the side of the sink (because while this pads the bottom of the sink, it doesn't do anything for the sides). But, for trips for newborns, this is a great option instead of the tub.
+1	I use this for sink baths for my 6 week old granddaughter.  It cushions herand keeps her from sliding around in the sink.  You do have to hold her with one hand,while washing with the other hand, if using the kitchen sink for a bath. I have not used itin the bath tub yet.  I do wish it was more of a wedge so the head area was elevated, that isthe only thing I would change.
+1	This is a great product for giving a newborn baths. You can put this inside of your infant tube as extra support. You also can give your baby a sponge bath in the sink(if you have a large sink) with it. It is also good to have an extra one to put the baby on after you get him/her out of the bath. It is easy to wash. However it does not hold up that well. I have washed mine several times and it starts to come apart/fade. This was not a problem for me because I only used it when my baby was very small.
+1	Holds baby well next to the sink when you want to merely sponge bathe him.  He rests on the comfy sponge and you can easily wash him with no issues.  Large enough for big babies.  Good for in the sink if sink is large enough.  Very thick so not sure it would work in a baby bathtub, as it is also pretty wide.  But for sinks and next to sink, this is PERFECT.
-1	Just bought a Joovy Groove.  needed a mom cup holder that could accommodate more than a thin water bottle.  Tried the Liquid Holster in store, didn't fit.  Bought this, it doesn't fit.  We also thought it would be hard to fit a short lidded cup in it without the upper handles pushing off the lid.  Going to return.
+1	Fits perfectly, holds any size cup snugly. And stays put without a problem. You can use it on any stroller.
+1	Much needed for our stroller since it did not come with a cup holder.Sturdy construction, adjustable clamp, and fits most size cups.
+1	I have an older Peg perego Pliko P3. I lost the cup holder that came with the stroller ages ago. I was looking for a cup holder that can hang off the side since the P3 doesn't have a horizontal handle bar. This cup holder is excellent.It was a little difficult to figure out how to attach it on to the stroller, but once I figured it out it was no problem. It is very sturdy and will not slip even if I have a full drink inside. I like that it can hold a larger cup. I get iced venti coffees all the time and they fit beautifully in this cup holder.
+1	Fits my Baby Jogger City Select perfectly. My stroller has a very thick, square handle bar and it fits with plenty of room to spare.
+1	This is one very serious cup holder that will never fail if installed right but that is hard to do. It seems like you install it one way, but you actually have to do something else. I'm pretty handy but this one was tricky to me. Instructions are atrocious.First, this cup holder will fit all thickness handles. I have a First Years Wave stroller which is very thick. It could've handled thicker and thinner just the same.Second, it does swivel to level your drink if installed on a diagonal bar. You have to press a button to make it swivel.Here is the trick--when you get it, the tab piece that goes around the bar comes bent in the middle and it feels like you put your bar in that part, tighten, and you are done. This is wrong.***HOW TO INSTALL***You should unbend the tab piece where you think the bar should go. Then, bend the piece again around your stroller to make a custom sized loop. This plastic is pretty thick that is probably why a lot of people don't think to do this. When you put the tab into the fastener, look at the treads and line them up before it goes in all the way in to make a tight fit. Then when you get it in, you use the screw thingy to make it even tighter. I also think that this is how you are supposed to install it and the instructions just aren't clear or people are not taking the time to read it.If you don't do this, installation will be loose and the drink will fall and you will complain.Someone had a tip on here to use kitchen grip pads around your bar. This is a good idea. I installed mine over the foam part of the stroller handle so I didn't need it but I would've liked some if I was installing over the metal part. Not necessary but would be a nice to have.
+1	I tried 6 different cup holders for my Baby Jogger City Versa (LOVE the stroller, by the way) and none of them worked until I tried this one. It was relatively easy to install and it fits great. The cup holder is big and feels sturdy. I was also able to easily remove the stickers so the cup holder looks like it belongs with my stroller. The stroller folds easily with the cup holder attached so there is no need to ever remove it.
-1	I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco.
+1	My wife loves it and it is a very nice material. A lil pricey  but not bad as a gift. It is very elegant compared to other that look like shower curtains. can use it as canopy and other stuff.
+1	I love Loved Baby products and I love this shawl! It is perfect for nursing with nursing shirts or not because it covers up everything! I am a 3rd time mom and always use this shawl and love it to death! I can't believe some people reviewed it so negatively...I love all Loved Baby products and my babies wear nothing else through their first 6 months of life! :)
+1	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.
-1	This poncho is large in all the wrong places. The sides are very short, and there's no way to hide yourself without moving the poncho sideways. You cannot see what's going on underneath it because the material is very thin and flimsy and there's no band around the neck part. So holding my baby with the right hand while holding open the collar with the left, isn't very comfortable. especially if you have large breasts.
+1	This nursing shawl is the best! Whether it is Summer or Winter, whether I am outdoors or indoors, this nursing shawl provides the best coverage and in incredibly convenient to grab out of the diaper bag or purse,  put it on for the nursing session (I find the ones with hoops  to be much more of a hassle), pack it up again very compact and toss it in the washer whenever the need arises. It is so lightweight it is perfect for warm weather and I do not have to worry about the sun getring into baby's eyes. In the winter it works just as well. I take it everywhere and would be so lost without it. Not only is it functional and incredibly versatile,  it is also very beautiful. I don't know how many complements I have received from other women and even men on how pretty it is. I am now pregnant with our second baby whom I plan on nursing as well and I cannot wait to continue to use this great item for many yeats to come. I really hope to buy another in a different color also.
+1	This cover is REALLY beautiful, and it doesn't scream: Hey, i'm nursing my baby!!! like those apron style, patterned covers. I know they give a better view of the baby, but you really only need to see what you are doing the whole time on the first few weeks, and I don't get out of the house much on those weeks anyway.  This one does'nt even look like a nursing item, covers front and back, takes up minimal space on a bag, and washes well. The neck opening is big enough that I can see my baby while she is getting latched, then quickly rearrange it once we are all set, for more modesty. I have the Grand Sand color, it's a little darker than in the picture, but very beautiful anyway, and goes well with most of my clothing.
+1	My other nursing covers are fine, but this one does not heat up as much underneath. My babies tend to help cool it down buy lifting up the covers and flashing the public. So far with this one my baby is content with feeding completely without exposing be because of the temperature. It is also the softest feeling cover I have seen and is very comfortable for me and my baby, plus it is longer than most as well.
+1	It's a decent product for the money, would recommend to others. It's machine washable, sturdy and has a nice design.
+1	This is a wonderful wooden brush/comb set.  Besides being an attactive set, it also works very well.  The bristles are soft.  Our munchkin was born with ALOT of hair and has enjoyed having his head brushed since the beginning.  Highly recommend this set.
+1	Easy solution to cracking... Don't wash the bristles!! If you really think about it, do you wash the bristles of the plastic comb and brush set that comes in your babies med kit??  Sugarbooger really needs to take that out of the direction label.
+1	My baby -newborn- loves when I brush her hair with this brush. She falls asleep. Wonderful purchase. I am very hapy with the quality and look of this item.
-1	The brush is adorable and the boar's hair is soft and perfect for a baby's fine hair.  The only downside is the quality.  When I received it, I washed the bristles in luke warm water and mild soap and dried it, bristle side down, overnight.  The next day, I found the wood warped and cracked in two places.  I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange it because I figured they would all do that.  I read in another person's review that this had happened to theirs too but figured that it was just that particular brush or that they didn't follow the washing instructions properly, but it's actually the brush itself.  If I don't find another brand that I like just as much as this one, I'll buy another and try again.
+1	I really enjoy this product. It's very convinient and keeps my diaper bag organized. However, I would recommend to have the dirty clothes bag to have a plastic lining on the inside - that would save a significant amount of time when it comes to having to wash it in the washing machine versus quickly cleaning it out and sanitizing it.
+1	I thought the bags would be small based on the image...but they are a nice size and really are very helpful in keeping our diaper bag organized.  It makes it very easy to quickly located what we need to grab in a pinch.  I washed one of the bags and I can tell from that that this product may not last for a long period of time.  Regardless of that it is still worth it for as long as they may last.
+1	I love the look and feel of this product. I highly recommend it. I really like how one size is see through so you I can remember exactly what I put in there! Enjoy!
-1	I bought this set a month before my baby was born. One of the smaller bags tore when I filled it with my babies toiletries. The bags are cute, but they are not durable. Once the bottom tears open you cannot use them again. I was very disappointed that they tore before my baby was even born! Ziploc bags are much better, and they're waterproof! Unlike this set of bags.
+1	The best toy I've bought for my son. He loves to spin the beads and the abcs. A type of toy that is very versatile with age.I also love that I bought mine on super clearance at Target for $[...]. Still can't believe the price.It was an amazing find.
+1	This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the "things" with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with "things" to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.
+1	First off, don't pay $75 for this -- I found it for about $40 on this site. Bought this for my nine month-old who is now ten months old; she loves it and plays with it every day. I worried after reading a review that a child fell on one and required stitches so I put it away for a bit. My mom (a retired kindergarten teacher of more than 25 years) told me I was being ridiculous and dragged it back out one day for my daughter. She said you would have to jump off something and land on the cube, or really be horsing around and fall hard on this to hurt yourself badly -- and she's right. All the edges are rounded and the top is covered with rubber covered wire that beads are on. A kid can get hurt on anything, and this toy is no worse than any other. The cube is so "busy" that it holds babies attention without loud annoying sounds or flashing lights. It's a nice quiet toy that is educational and fun, and if you ask me, there are precious few of those around these days. I highly recommend it. It's also built very well -- it looks like a toy from yesteryear, carefully and lovingly crafted with hand-painted images. My mom as an early childhood educator thinks this toy is great. Well worth the money.
+1	I've seen these before, but never really gave them much thought. When I took my 15 month old son to the doctor for his latest check-up, they had a similar version of this in the office...he was absolutely enthralled with it. Since we had to go to Wal-mart afterwards, I figured I'd check to see if they sold something similar...that's where I found this (much cheaper I might add).For such a simple toy, my son just loves it. He's sitting in the middle of the living room playing with it as I type this. His favorite is the bead coaster on top, but he also really likes the abacus on the side. I absolutely recommend this toy (or even something similar if this particular one doesn't interest you). Even when he gets tired of it and moves on to something else, he always comes back to this cube. I'm VERY happy with this purchase.
+1	I've been searching high and low for a sippy cup for my baby who never took a bottle and transitioned straight to a sippy.  The good thing about this cup is that you can tilt it upside down and there's a small drip of liquid that comes out.  In other words, it is not spill proof.  It works for my child because he's doesn't really suck the liquid out so the small drip will allow him to learn that there is liquid in the cup and he can start to suck.  Also, it allows the parents to "force" them to drink.  It's a good quality cup.  It's thick (not the cheapy plastic) and the lid is very secure.  It is also super easy to clean.  There are only 2 parts to it (cup and lid!). These days, the sippy cups are so fancy and super hard to clean.  You can also use this as a plain cup without the lid once your child graduates from a sippy.  It makes a great kids's cup.
+1	This is the best sippy cup I've found, and I've gone through quite a few.  What a waste of money with all the other cups I've been through; for the same amount of $$ I could've gotten these plus change left over!  My baby wasn't able to suck out of all the "leak proof" sippy cups (and I've bought at least 3-4 others) but these he'll happily use.  Plus, it's a two for one because you can use it as a regular cup afterwards.  And there are only two parts to wash!One thing you have to beware of though --  DO NOT BOIL these per the instructions!  I did, and it warped the lids so badly there was no way it would fit back onto the cups; so minus one star.  Since they were cheap I just got more.
+1	Our daughter is picky when it comes to sippy cups. I remember using these cups when I was her age and I liked them. So I went on the hunt to find them. After going to every store around us I finally went on Amazon.com and typed in what I was looking for. And sure enough these cups came up. I ordered 6 cups all together. Though they do spill a little when they are tipped that are great. Our daughter like them and they are easy for her to drink out of.
+1	I love these cups!!! I highly recommend them.I remember having the similar Tupperware cups when I was little. These seem to work just as good and are so inexpensive. Each cup has a lid (no valve, so it will leak a little). The lids stay on tight. I got them for my 18 mo old who was really good at drinking from open cups but also knocked them over fairly often. These are nice because he gets more liquid quickly but if he knocks it over, it's just a small drip and not the whole cup poured out. I had to train him to set his cup on a table and not just drop it around the room like he was used to doing with a sippy cup. But he picked that concept up pretty quickly. I still keep sippy cups around for the car and diaper bag, but these are great for around the house. They have held up really well to dishwasher use over several months. And I really like that the cup doesn't have ridges at the top, so it is just a cup and easier to drink from if we aren't using the lid.
+1	I bought these originally for my daughter who is now 6 years old.  We bought more of them for my son who is now 3 years old.  and I just recently bought some more for our daughter who just turned 1.  So yes, we love these cups!  My wife had bought all manner of different cups for the kids over the years and our cabinets were overflowing with different cups and lids.  It was a nightmare trying to find matching sets quickly while a toddler is screaming and pulling at your leg!  I begged her to toss everything except these cups, which stack neatly.  She met me halfway and tossed about half of the assorted bottles/cups.  These cups with the cover work great for our 1 year old.  They also still work good without lids for the older kids.  Since the cups are cheap and shipping isn't, I recommend buying in groups of at least three, you won't be sorry!
+1	This are soft and full and help support my son's head.  They also are big enough to help hold his WannuNub Monkey passifier.  We ended up buying two pair.
+1	I love this because they have enough padding to protect and almost make a pillow. the little teddy bear heads are so padded that it keeps my 2 year olds head up when he falls asleep. I have used this since he was born so over two years. I just throw them in the wash every few months or when something spills on them. They still work great. I ordered two more.. one for my older son (3 years old) whose head always flops down and for our new baby coming in two months. Love this product.
+1	Super soft, fits great.  Matches car seat perfect.  Good little things so my baby girls neck isn't scratched!  Quality bad cute.
+1	I love this Cot. My son feels like he has his own special bed when we have to stay in a hotel or at grandmas. It is REAL easy to set up and put away without having to explain it to anyone. I would recommend it to anyone with a toddler that may be going on a trip or having sleep overs.
+1	With 4 of us it gets a little much to have everyone in the bed when we travel, this was perfect for my 3 year old when we traveled for the holidays and even when we moved and had to wait a few weeks before getting an additional bed for his room.
+1	I got two of these for my younger boys unfortunately my 5 year old is to tall for it but I have plenty of other kids around so it will get used very handy at nap time or when we go out at the lake pop it up under a tree when one is tired or even just for them to sit on. love this product I have sat on it to make sure it will hold more then one I am about 150 did just fine didn't bend or tear very well made
+1	Like most people, I read the reviews before purchasing this and decided to just give it a go. We used it this past weekend for 4 nights at the ocean for our 2 year old, and she loved it (as did we!). The biggest complaint that I read about was a strap that went across the cot on the bottom in the middle, however, I can tell you that there is no strap. The bed hangs there with nothing to interfere it, like a hammock. No straps or bars across the middle of it.My daughter went to sleep on this without even giving us any grief (you should see bed times at home!). So we know it was comfortable for her.The bed comes with a cover, it's so thin though, I'm not sure why it is there. We had a couple leaky diapers when we were on vacation and we were able to wipe this down with soap and water. I was about to complain about the fact that you cant take the cover off of the stand, but, after further inspection, we found that it can just be unbolted from the frame. I hate buying baby/toddler things that aren't machine washable, it's so unpractical. So I am so happy to say that this wasn't the case with this.It says to handwash, but we threw it in the wash machine when we got home (on a super gentle cycle) and it came out as good as new.The fact that the top can come off and the fact that my daughter was comfortable on this enough not to try to get into our bed, makes it a wonderful product. I whole heartedly recommend it.I will aslo apologize for my lack of knowledge on what to call certain parts of this cot - I am happy to clarify if needed.
+1	We got this for when we're traveling in hotels and didn't want to pay excessive nightly charges for cots that are old, rusted out, and sometimes unavailable. This is exactly what we were expecting and are very happy with our purchase.This accommodated our 2.5 year old who is 36' tall and 35 lbs with plenty more room to spare.I would have given this 5 stars if there was more padding, but it was VERY easy to put a extra blanket under the liner/sheet (that's included) for extra cushion.
-1	This cot has a support stiffness that is in the material running through the center like where the child's waist would be.  It sticks up higher than the top and bottom of the bed so it is very uncomfortable if the child is lying on their back.  I'm going to find another cot.
+1	I bought this for our granddaughter for napping and for when we are visiting overnight elsewhere.  She likes it so far.  Very easy setup and just her size.  She is just turning two, but it should work for at least a couple of years.  I also bought a Disney Nap Mat that works well with it for nap time.
+1	I bought outdoors to write, my son will sleep here.He is more like this than his own bed.Although a little uncomfortable, a good nap self.He slept well in the comfort of home.
+1	We love this cot. Most toddlers will fit very nicely. My 6 year old is very petite for her age and still probably has another year on it. I would not get this for ages 6 and above. They will probably not be in it for long. Although, it is a great price and quality, even if you only get a year or so! I will say that we usually end up &#34;padding&#34; it with a blanket or two and then the sleeping bag on top of that.
+1	We ordered this for our 2 1/2 year old since he has outgrown the pack and play and we needed somewhere for him to sleep when traveling.  This works great!  Setting it up is a breeze, and it seems very sturdy.  It takes up much less room in the trunk than the pack and play.  He had no problem sleeping on this during a recent trip.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that the sheet that comes with it is not very good.  It's rough and doesn't seem comfortable.  You could easily throw a crib sheet on it though.
+1	We purchased this for our three year old.  We plan to keep it as a travel bed for her when we spend the night away from home.  To get her used to it, we set it up in the living room and she loved it instantly.  It's low enough to the ground that we don't worry about her falling out and is long enough for her to stretch out with plenty of room to spare.  It breaks down in seconds and it incredibly easy to put into the travel bag.  So glad we purchased this item.
+1	My daughter loves this! It's not very padded but she doesn't seem to mind. I have a napper that goes on top of it to make it a bit cozier. It's super lightweight and easily portable
-1	It was great to open it up and watch how my little boy got excited over it, but he never stayed in the bed.  It was ok for sitting on or playing on, but not for lying on.  I discovered when putting him to bed at my in-laws, that there wasn't enough clearance between the cot pad and the metal brace/structure beneath it, so the middle support bars were essentially digging into his lower back.I returned it, and when I saw that Wal-Mart carried the same item, opened up the box and set up the item in store...no such problem.I considered getting another one, but it was also a little bulky when trying to travel by air (just barely fit into our largest rolling bag, and took up half the bag!)  Instead, I ended up going for two kids' air-mattress beds with attached sleeping bags that were on clearance at a local sports store.  Both of them together take up less space than this portable cot, it's more comfortable for my kids, and it's easy enough to make repairs if they get punctured...
+1	Add me to the huge list of fans! We bought one about a year ago, wanting to use it for... I don't even remember. But since then, we've used it for naps, for &#34;campouts&#34; in the living room, for time out spots since we have two toddlers and putting both in one room is just.. not wise, and it's been fantastic.It has survived a potty training toddler, two toddlers sleeping on it (not sure how...) and many many spills.It did not, however, survive daddy sitting on it. It got awfully bent. Still usable, but not pretty.I love that it's so lightweight, and easily folds away. It's also easy to put out in the yard and spray down with a hose after a potty training accident.I do not love that it doesn't support more weight, but mostly because I'm jealous.
+1	I purchased this for my 2.5 year old for traveling and he loves it. It folds up so small and takes up little space in the car. When unfolded, it's a comfortable place for my toddler to nap and sleep at night.
+1	Arrived as expected and in great condition.  Comes with a blue sheet.  My son, who is 4, set it up by himself and slept great.  Easily fits back in carry case.  Compact and easy to transport.
+1	We purchased this cot in Sept of 2013 to take to our trip to Disney World for our 2 year old to sleep on. (Big family, not enough beds) My son is a larger 2 year old. He weighs approx 38 lbs.The cot comes in a carrying bag with it's own sheet. It is very similar to those cloth folding chairs and super easy to set up. Just pull it open and press down to flatten it. I was impressed with the quality of this cot considering the price. I thought it would be adequate for the trip and that we would likely never use it again so I wasn't very concerned with durability however that thought went right out the window once we got home.The cot worked wonderfully for our vacation! He loved having his own private bed and was excited to go to sleep every night.We do not use the sheet that came with the cot. We use a crib mattress protector that is pretty thick to add some padding and protect the cot from accidents and a crib sheet. That gives his cot a &#34;personalized&#34; look that makes him even happier to sleep on it!The cot does warn you to NOT JUMP on it. However, a 2 year old is not going to always heed to these warnings. We have to yell at him frequently to not stand, walk, or jump on the cot. He has not broken it totally but he has caused some damage. The two points on the sides that connect to the frame have started to tear. The cot is still usable but if he continues to jump on it he would surely destroy it. If a child jumped on it for an extended amount of time it would definitely tear and be useless.My son is afraid of sleeping in his room. So nightly he comes into our room in the middle of the night and sleeps on his cot. It has held up well for this.I HIGHLY recommend this cot and advise to use a crib protector if you have a young child that has night time accidents.
+1	We purchased this cot for a two-year-old who visits over the weekends. He immediately took possession of his bed and slept soundly. We didn't worry about his falling off at all. The cot is perfect for small kids. We throw on a comforter for a bit of cushioning (which is the only thing the cot lacks.) For the price, this cot is a great investment.
+1	I bought this bed for my 2year old grandson for traveling. I thought he was too big to use the pack and plays. He loves his "big boy bed" It is so easy to set up and take down, much better than a pack and play and it's low so if he does fall out he won't get hurt. He also likes to stand on it and it is very solid and doesn't tip easily.Update May 2012 This bed is still going strong after use and abuse of 3 kids. All of the kids used it for naps and for traveling when they got too big for the pack and play.Plus I often find the kids playing with it in the playroom for their stuffed animals. I definetly recommend this bed!
+1	So far, so good!  We've used  this several times for travel for my 2.5 year/old.  I wouldn't say she loves it, exactly (she would rather be sleeping in the big bed) but it's a great, convenient solution for a kid that has outgrown a pack n' play.  It comes with a sheet, which has washed well, and seems reasonably comfortable.  No bar in the center - that design flaw has been corrected.  Love it!
+1	Works out well for the 3 year old that sleeps on it.  She loves it!  I put a blanket over the bed so there are no issues with anything poking her.  Love that it folds up and stores in a small package.  Great buy for the price!
+1	My 17 month old loves to sleep in it. She even sits on it to watch her favorite cartoons. Although it doesn't seem like it is very comfortable if you put a blanket on it, its all it needs to make it softer
+1	These cots are really convenient. My 2 year old has used one and my 5 year old has used one. NO complaints. Slept just fine using these at grandmas house.
+1	Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal BlueWhat a great little invention! Perfect for sleepovers at grandma and grandpas house!
+1	We paid around $20 for our first one and it has lasted for over a year. Our 3 year old has used it many times with no issues at all. She looks forward to trips because of her special bed. I read a few reviews where people complained about durability, but I don't know what they were expecting at such a low price point. We have no complaints so far. We bought a second cot for our second child.
+1	Both my boys, 3 and 2 love this cot. They sleep well on it overnight in hotel rooms. Best part is the cot fits perfectly between the wall and the bed in hotels, so there is no room for roll offs! Need to purchase another one!!
+1	Our 2.5 year old girls have outgrown their pack n plays and we were looking for something for them to sleep on when we travel.  These are fantastic.  The girls fit on them well and slept through the night on them.They are a canvas material, similar to what you see on camping chairs.  They come with their own fitted sheet you can wash.  I used that, but also put a toddler bed size fitted sheet on top of it to make it softer.  Because it is a cot, it bows a little in the middle, which seemed to be enough to keep my girls from rolling off onto the floor.  They slept on them for 4 nights and didn't roll off once.The legs are designed in such a way that even when your child lays down, the cot does not rest on any of the legs (no bars in your back).  I was worried about that when I saw the design, but it was not an issue.They fold up sort of like a camping chair (of course a little bigger).  It is much smaller than the pack n play was folded up, which helps with the packing.  You simply pull the bed out of the bag, open it, put the sheet on, and you are all set.  There is no assembly or set up.  You just open and use it.  It folds up just as simply and is easy to get back into the bag.I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling with toddlers.Update:  We ordered this in February of 2013.  Here it is October of 2013 & my girls have outgrown it.  In all fairness, we probably kept them in pack n plays too long.  But, on a recent trip, in trying to turn over, one of our girls rolled on the floor.  They were just about the right size for it, as long as they didn't move.  We tried them in a bed together on our last trip, lined with pillows.  We had a little learning curve & a couple falls out of bed (I know, same problem as the cot), but by the end of the week, we figured it out and feel more confident next time we travel.  I would make sure you have enough of a window to use it, or have more kids coming up (we just have the twins) to make the purcahse worthwhile.
+1	This really helped out when we went back to see the parents. my 30 lbs 3 year found it comfy enough to sleep on.
+1	My 4 year old like it when he sleeps in my parents room, and is great for travelling its similar to what they use to sleep in his day care.  No assembly required, easy to fold.  Toddler bed crib sheets is a perfect fit.
+1	I bought this as a transition between crib and bed for our grandsonWe still have not used it yet, but the time is coming soon. My grandsonDid try it and felt it was great.
+1	I've long looked for a good travel bed option.  I tried the Peapod tent that got great reviews, but my daughter refused to ever get into it.  I eyed the blow up mattresses for kids, but didn't really want to have to use a pump every time we traveled, plus I hate how air mattresses are loud and move around.  So we continued to lug our heavy pack and play around.  But when my daughter finally outgrew the pack and play, and we were getting NO sleep whenever we traveled and tried to have her sleep in our bed with us, I finally decided to try this portable cot.  Its great!  Very inexpensive, compared to other travel bed options.  And the best part is that it is so quick and easy to set up, which is perfect since it seems we always arrive at our destination late at night and want to quickly put the kids to bed.  When it arrived I pulled it out of the box and unfolded it and thought that it couldn't possibly be that easy, but it was.  Personally it seems a little hard to me but my daughter has always slept on a cot at daycare, so she took to this just fine.  The length works okay, I am guessing she will be able to use it until around 4 and 1/2 (she is on the shorter side).  Somehow she doesn't fall off, even though she moves around quite a bit while sleeping.  I think this is a good buy for the money.
+1	My two boys loved sleeping on these cots when camping this summer.  I just wish they were a little bit longer.  As it is, my 4 year old barely fit on it.  It was the perfect size for my 2.5 year old.  Both boys are tall for their age, but I really wish we could use these cots again for them next summer!The sheet that comes with them is thin, but does the trick.  As another review mentioned, a standard crib sheet is just about the right size for these as well.
+1	First off, our toddler LOVES this cot. He was crying today because he broke his cot! He's only 2 and under 40lbs and has never jumped on it. But he does stand on the corner before he lies down on it, which is exactly where the thin-walled tubing cracked and broke. It was a Christmas present and lasted exactly 6 months. It traveled well (even fit in my large suitcase no problem) and was great for light use. But my boy loved it so much (especially in warmer weather) that he started using it all the time. And that's where this product fails. Summary: Great product for occasional use but flimsy construction doesn't permit day-to-day use.*UPDATE* Regalo identified this as a manufacturing defect that was addressed and fixed in later models. They are sending a new cot free of charge. Great customer service! I have increased the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Thanks Regalo!
+1	This is a durable, portable, little cot. We travel a lot. This is perfect when you have made the transition to toddler bed, and you don't want to drag the pack n play around again.
+1	My 2.5 yrs old sleeps on this just fine, no complaints.  Very portable, very easy to get out of the way.  Perfect for those nights sleeping outside the house.  This one is certainly a keeper.  No bars get in the way of her body so it doesn't get uncomfortable at all.
+1	cute cot and easy to set up. has a washable cover too.
+1	Great travel cot. No assembly required, just folds right out and back up again. Light weight, removable cover can be washed. Best for 4yrs and under based on length of item.  Quite honestly, it's so cheap you should just go ahead and buy it, you'll love it!
+1	we purchased to keep at grandmas that lives out of state but we visit often! kids love it! compact easy fold to store!
+1	I am trying to get my daughter used to sleeping on this since it's so much less expensive than a toddler bed, before we actually buy her the real deal. I actually got it at Walmart (same price), and like everyone else says, it takes less than a minute to unfold. It's not padded so I folded a blanket under the sheet. It comes w a sheet but I didn't like it so I just used a crib sheet. Since they r a smidge big I pulled the 2  wall corners under the frame legs.Now down to business. My daughter crawled all over it for hours n played w her toys on it. I, kept having to remind her to sit down, not stand. 1.5 hours. once I rocked her to sleep she fell right to sleep. I would say this is a winner.
